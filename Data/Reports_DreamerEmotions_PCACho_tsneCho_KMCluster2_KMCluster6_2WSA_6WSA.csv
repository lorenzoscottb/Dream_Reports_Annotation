I look at the kitchen, which has two or three wooden oak tables (dining room type) hanging way up on the wall for counter space. That will be awkward. Dwight/Howard comes in and I am frustrated trying to get his attention. He finally listens to my ideas but sighs and says, ""It won't work. We made a mistake buying this rambling house and a mistake moving to M City. We belong back in the valley, so let's not take such care where things go and only unpack the essentials until we can move again."" He then suggests we be friends again. I say, ""No way."" Now I kind of give up and sit on the couch with an older woman. I make a snide remark about how she can't work either because she's so old, and I can't work, cause I'm so old too. It's a sort of frustrated joke. Nothing seems to be going right. No one is helping.

And no matter how much I liked the song that was playing, I was forced into the next car. It was really hot in the train so I was wearing my bathing suit. The train stopped at my high school's dining hall. I went in and everyone was studying for exams. I sat down at a table with my friends in my bathing suit. Ashley came up behind Olivia and put a lobster in her hair and we all screamed. Then she came after me with another lobster, so I ran away. I finally got back to my table and grabbed my bags before heading back to my dorm. On the way I saw Matthew and David, but they ignored me. Frustrated, I parachuted (yes, parachuted) away. I was so scared of Olivia and angry that Matthew and David had ignored me. When I got to the dorm, I realized that it was the beginning of school, even though I had just seen everyone studying for final exams. I realized I didn't live here anymore, so then I rushed to my new dorm where I found Sue. She told me that she, Hannah, 3 other girls, and I all shared a room in Bundy. When I got inside, I saw Hannah rearranging the furniture in a way-too-small room for 6 girls. I remember being furious that Hannah and I had to share a room with 4 other girls on Bundy 1, where all of Ms. Prong's favorite varsity athletes lived. I thought there had to be some mistake. I went to the closet to put my stuff there and realized that I had left all my clothes somewhere else. I ran back to the dining hall to look for them.

Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $10 and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $10. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy.

I had the book and started to look it up. Just then my mother drove to pick me up and I left him. Then suddenly it was the first day of school. I was in the history wing and Ed was trying to show me something. He was pulling me somewhere and out of the middle of nowhere, Wyatt wanted to show me something different, so he began to pull me in the opposite direction. It was chaos because for some reason, it was also Parents Weekend. There were people everywhere. In the middle of everything, Gwenyth Paltrow was singing out of the blue. I was so exhausted; I finally went to my dorm. On the way, I met someone who gave me a pancake they wanted me to feed to the Maples' dog. I took a bite of the pancake and it was really good. When I was near the science building, the dog came out of nowhere and began to bite me. I was so angry and scared that I ran to my room in Houk. My room was completely deserted except for a queen-sized bed in the middle, the room with my Laura Ashley sheets on them. There was a secret passageway into my real room where Maria and Zoey were getting dressed. I realized that my clothes were too small, so I had to borrow some of Maria's hideous clothes. Andrea was there too. I finally went back to the main building only to realize that I had no schedule. I couldn't figure out what classes I had. I searched everywhere and went to my mailbox to find it. Jessica came to me and told me that the teachers were trying something different; on the first day of school everyone would just go to their classes whenever they wanted just to see if they liked them. I went to English and then to history. In history, Mr. Singer brought us down to the soccer field where there was a car race.

She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris.

We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like ""Antique M&Ms,"" where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another.

So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused.

At the end, Lou got up to play a song (I was already over him) and he sang this beautiful love song to Marion. So that made me sort of sad, but I told myself I'd gotten over him anyway. And then Lance told me that it had actually been my name there in the song, but that Lou had changed it last minute because he didn't want me to know how he felt. So I decided to tell him instead. I knew he was in my brother's old room and the poor guy couldn't go to sleep because he was in there with some girl. I knocked on the door and said, ""Excuse me, you can't be in there and you need to come out now. We won't watch you come out, but you need to."" I was hoping that by hearing my voice, Lou would tell me he loved me. But instead he said, ""We'll get out as soon as you make us a hotel reservation and bring us some fiber pills."" At this, I thought my mother was in there because she takes fiber pills, so I wrenched the door open, and sure enough, Lou was lying there with my mother. Horrified, I slammed the door and started yelling, crying, and screaming. Lou didn't seem to care. I ran downstairs to get a phone book and threw it onto the bed yelling, ""Make your own stinking, dirty hotel reservation"" and all he did was laugh. I was so upset that I begged Sue to let me stay at her house. She was already having a sleepover with Hannah, so I slept in the living room. Mrs. Dunn made sure I had everything I wanted, and Mr. Dunn asked me about my college search. Sue had already gotten in somewhere, I think.

Then I came home and my father had to fight these monsters working with Voldemort in the lake. He had a gun that looked like the remote control, and he got frustrated when I couldn't understand how it worked. I cut up his purple and white boxers to use as Clothies, because I didn't know when I'd see him again.

I went into my brother's room and jumped into his bed, nearly hysterical with fear, begging him to let me sleep there. My brother had this nail in his back, which I guess was serving as his stitches. The evil Fritz came in with the creamer and ripped the nail out of his back, and I screamed. Apparently, the nail was a family heirloom of Slytherin. There was also a cactus on my brother's bedside table, and it was a Horcrux that Voldemort used. He recovered because all of a sudden, he and Russell and Ted and I were all on the run from Voldemort. We were running around London and my high school, which was in London, trying to escape. We ran into my room and my roommate was Ron. Hector was chasing us too.

The general ""plot"" or ""theme"" of this dream is that Mary has returned to our apartment after shopping and starts preparing a meal for us in the apartment kitchen. I am very concerned and upset that Mary is doing these things because I know she is very weak. I try urging her to stop and to rest, but she is paying no attention to me and just continues preparing the meal. I return to the dining room, then hear a strange noise - sounds like someone falling on the floor, or like the sound of toast when it is done and pops up in the toaster. I run to the kitchen, but don't look on the floor but at the counter on which the toaster stands. The toast is burned and an empty teapot is turned on its side. I just feel something terrible has happened.

In the dream I recognize them as ours. The argument is about Mary's decision to leave me. She tells me she is going to leave me because I don't love her. Her proof of this is that I don't have sex with her often enough. I am flabbergasted. I believe that our lack of frequent sex is her fault. While I have a great deal I want to say to her about this, I just can't get anything out of my mouth. I want to ask her why she always falls asleep ion the sofa, night after night. This prevents me from having sex if she's not beside me in bed. I also wanted to remind her of how very emphatic she was about not wanting sex when we had vacationed in the Bahamas. I'll never forget her comment: ""Ed, I didn't come on holiday to have sex."" I also wanted to remind her that she is ill and having sex is next to impossible. But somehow I am not able to say any of these things. I seem to be babbling. All I can do is plead with her to stay with me. I insist that I do love her. But Mary is firm in her statement that she plans to leave me. At one point in our heated discussion, one or both of us, are momentarily concerned that the children are witnessing our argument. But we quickly decide that they are going to know about our problems eventually, so they might as well learn at first hand what it's all about. Then Mary left the room.

Again I washed them off with water and noticed with surprise that they were filled with tarnished copper--not silver at all. I was also amazed when I discovered none of the teeth had roots, but instead were held in place by little copper plates. Again I felt very guilty.

Suddenly one girl stood up and came close to me. I was surprised by her good looks. She bent down and kissed me. I felt thrilled. I put my arms around her and picked her up. We danced for a while. I was taken by her beauty. She was a most beautiful creature. I went wherever she went. I received a thrill every time she touched me. I wanted her badly.

M,Y,set,Hall/VdC Norms: Male,norms-m,1940s-1950s,Missing,0500,I was standing near the bank of a river. The surroundings were dark and suspicious and I was afraid. I suddenly felt myself falling into space without even coming to a halt. Suddenly I plunged into the icy cold water. I could not swim. I cried for help. I heard someone calling and coming toward me. He began laughing at me. I looked at him. He was an old schoolmate of mine whom I detested. He laughed again and said he would let me drown. I screamed and as rapidly as I screamed he laughed. I felt myself drowning but he wouldn't help me. Then the scene became blank. I plunged into darkness fighting for breath. I was afraid. I felt a pressure against me. I wanted help but received only a little laugh.
