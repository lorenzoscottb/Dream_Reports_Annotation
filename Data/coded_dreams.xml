			<report><![CDATA[For the second night in a row, I dreamed of Jon. He was trying to make an impression on me. He embarrassed me! Then I dreamed that Reta and I saw Blake in a restaurant and we went in and had a coke. Some kids were dancing and I was wishing Blake would ask me. He did. We bopped all over. When it was done, we  sat down. He said, "Your hair's messed up." I said, "Oh, dear, not again" (He had his arm around me). He bent to me and said, "Yes-let's mess up a mustache" and then he kissed me. The kiss was so real! Then I dreamed that Nate came home. I met him in S City at the bus depot. He was 6 feet tall and all muscles. He grabbed my hands and then threw his arms around me and kissed me,(All these dreams were when I was fast asleep). [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a horrible dream. Howard was in a coffin. I yelled and screamed at his mom that it was all her fault. I kicked myself that I hadn't waited to become a widow rather than a divorcee in order to get the insurance. I woke up feeling miserable, the dream was so icky. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Again, I am in a richly decorated room, a large bed. I am eating very sweet rolls, butterscotch on sweet rolls. I am suspicious of it. A man has been "sent" by another man to make love to me. I am vaguely aware of all this and I'm suspicious. A thought occurs that, "Now it is OK. The sweets are fresh and not poisoned or drugged." The man leaves and the "original" man comes to me. A feeling of being pursued, not frightening. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[As I was "waking up" from a nap, Ginny and Rosemary were perched on my bed. Ginny was doing Math. I watched her count columns, carry and write numbers as she figured and I said, "You do math like me." She wasn't doing well. Then I got worried. I said, "Oh Lord, I'm sure that I'm signed up for an intro to German class, but I forgot to go to any classes and it's late in the term. I'll flunk." I started looking through my filing cabinet for the register form. I saw some B'day cards scrunched in there. Rosemary said, "Take those out." I had to see a boy standing on his head trying to say something but no one would listen. It was a B'day card to the devil. He had a grotesque red face, with huge reddish teeth. He was standing very large in a formal striped suit with a tie and carnation and a huge overcoat on. His coarse, snaky tail was draped around him. No fear. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had the most incredible dream. I was back in the hospital only it was a sort of school. I'd just been informed that I was going to be executed at 9:00 the next morning because I'd not gone to a meeting. I was paralyzed with fear and the enormity of the injustice. My 2 roommates, also condemned, went home for the night to be with friends and family. I didn't have anyone special to go to, so I stayed. Someone (perhaps my alter ego), came to me and said, "Come on, let's fight this. We'll go talk to them. They won't do it." We flew, over a muddy, cold, choppy lake. A lady in a helicopter was who we were to speak to. My friend advised me to speak confusingly, not good to be clear and direct. It didn't work. I was back in my room. The chaplain came in. He brought me a "form 52, a form of protest" to fill out. If I filled it out, they'd have to stop the execution and deliberate. He said, "Sometimes it takes them 'til summer!" [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had another strange dream, about kittens. The 3rd one. This one, I gave birth to 1 dozen kittens for their mother. I called her over. She moved them to a drawer nest, one bright orange one, one yellow one. I said they would be mine. The rest would be given away. They were cute, fuzzy, and playful. There was a puppy in this dream too. Strange. What does this symbolize to me? [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Back at a place like uni house. The kids and I are going to see the movie "Tell Me that you Love me Junie Moon." We get to the concert hall. I see some friends (blonde woman), and the kids go to sit by them. I look in a side room. A circle of people sitting in chair (regular ones) forming. I chat for a moment and then go to join my kids. I see an empty space behind friends. I must "tightrope" walk a bench (blonde wood). As I almost get there, my "friends" get up and leave like strangers (I had overslept and was late to movie). Now I'm at a house. It's late at night and dark. Fletcher walks in. I say, "Hi." We talk. I say, "So, on your way back to Hawaii?" (He wore a Hawaiian shirt). He is surprised that I know so much about him. Generally he's cool and distant but when I read him right, he really looks at me. He starts to make love to me. He doesn't really care about me or how I feel. He has an orgasm. Then I feel an orgasm coming. He sucks my breasts. They are flabby and old. I am at first embarrassed. Then I don't care. I get in a dominant position and go for an orgasm. I kiss his ear. He is non-responsive. He's like Raul, but skinny like Elliot. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A wedding. The guests were dressed up like for Halloween, Witches, etc. The bride came and stood at the alter. A male in drag, crying (fake), and exaggerating a coquettish female, came down the aisle (raked steps like the theater at the community college). He was the "groom." Then after he got to the aisle, he took off his mask and was an usher. The real groom (male), came down the steps. The female minister in costume was replaced by a male, "real" minister.

			<report><![CDATA[Paul McCartney and my "friends" were on one side of a room, and the Arabs were on the other. A chain link fence was between us but there were gaps in it. Paul started yelling insults and taunts at the Arabs. I said, "Stop it." I stood up and walked to him. The Arabs started yelling back and coming into "our" side of the room to fight. I was in the middle; I made them go back. Paul and the others started up again. I again tried to stop them. One Arab thanked me. Then, they all started again and I gave up. It was too big. I gathered up some things and left the room. Now I was in the hall. I said, "I want to get away, where there's no people." Paul said, "You want to go camping?" I'm not enthused. I want a fireplace, etc. My father said, "You can go somewhere remote, if you can handle traveling over the Texas desert." I ask if we can go where there are no hunters. I don't want to get shot.

			<report><![CDATA[A dinosaur. I am on its back. A large beautiful snake, green and shiny, with gold threads, is its driver. I must hold on to her head just behind the jaw to keep from getting bit and to control where to go. She tries to bite me. I have to be very strong to keep her under control. I am struggling hard and I almost can't do it. She turns to look at me and says, "'Little girls' shouldn't (or couldn't) do this." [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Later, I'm being chased by people in 4 helicopters. They are trying to shoot me. I get on top of a green airplane just barely larger than my body. I lay down on it so it and I are the same configuration. I control the speed with my hands on the prop. We fly over a big shiny lake. I look back. Two men run and jump into the lake to escape the helicopter. They land head first in shallow water from the waist to the feet. They are out of the water (standing on their heads) I go over a mountain, calling ahead to get permission of the airport to land quickly. At first they refuse. I have to wait my turn, heavy traffic. I tell them this is an emergency. They say, "O.K., you'll have 10 seconds between planes." I then get inside the plane. I think, "No, I don't want to, I feel trapped," but then I decide to because I would have metal around me and the chair back to stop bullets. I land. Then I'm in a huge house sort of like M City, only there are lots of windows everywhere (like at in-service old club house). I tell people, "Duck down, or you'll get shot." A mixture of people are there. Chuck, Dylan and lots of young college age women. One young woman wants to know what's going to happen to our deal over the yarn if some of us get shot. I am impatient with her. I say, "If I get shot, the yarn's yours, O.K.? The rest we'll worry about later." I go downstairs. Two Seans come in, nonchalantly. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Howard is driving a beat up VW bus. His wife Karen, the kids and I are in the bus. I am the in passenger seat. I see Howard going to sleep as he drives. I am angry. I yank the driver's seat from him. We argue. He is on a bended knee next to my right side, trying to get close to me. I feel very closed in, rigid. Karen pleads with me to see his need to drive and to be close. I'm angry and I argue that it's best for me to drive and that I don't like him anyway, so there! The brakes are weak and I have trouble stopping or slowing us down when it is needed. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A secret door.  I started to go through the back door. 2 men were blocking the way.  I shut the door and went through a side secret door. It led to an old abandoned room. Somehow I had made a time change. I was back in pre-historic times, in a cave. I stood near the mouth of the cave and an eerie light (green phosphorous) shone on me. I cast my image out into the night to look scary. It scared the natives. I saw some children swimming from school, raging water. This was ordinary for them. 1 girl had to walk on land the long way around. The clansmen talked about raising the bridge the children walked on so it was above the water in storms so they wouldn't have to swim so dangerously. I met a man, a caveman. I was intelligent and seemed to know things (realized memories from modern times would unconsciously filter through and I would solve problems). Others felt nervous about me, because I was so good at figuring things out. A plane landed on the swimming place. A man got out, and pushed the light craft up to shore so it wouldn't float away.

			<report><![CDATA[A vocational rehab counselor was questioning me about my cousin Sonja and her capabilities as a VR counselor in the coast office. I told him that Sonja and I go back as far as birth. She had a few things to learn yet, but she was pretty good. He said he wanted to know more. We got into a car and drove to the M City house. There was some snow on the ground. I suggested that he park in the driveway. I say, "Turn right into the driveway." He obstinately turned left into a bank of dirt and snow. He and I agree that that won't do. He turned the car around and parked on the street, facing the "bad corner." I was concerned but saw another car was parked right on the corner so that we were protected from collision. We go into the house. I took him the full length of the house to the far end. I say, "Let's start at the oldest part." It was a freshly remodeled room, empty of furniture, and freshly painted. I told him how this used to be a half-finished garage. I pointed out where the grape vines used to be. It was now a lovely wall with windows. We moved to the next room, the rec room. I pointed to the door. I said, "It used to be somewhere else. I still can't get used to it being there and it startles me when it opens. It too has been freshly remodeled." As he and I had driven up to the house, I had pointed out the rising creek that was in flood stage. I told him that sometimes the creek came right up to the door and sometimes came in and started to flood the house. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had some company and they left. I was tired and wanted to sleep. I could sleep sitting up in the van, passenger side, or sleep on the bench seat in the back. Both ways I'd be uncomfortable and cold, so I went to Thea's house and slept in a bed there. They weren't home. I woke up the next day and was getting ready to leave. I came out of the bedroom and found Thea and someone else there. She lectured me about taking advantage of her, using her house without permission, and she asked me if I had used anything else. I was quite annoyed with her. I wanted to leave. It didn't seem polite to leave in the middle of her lecture. She was angry. So was I. I felt guilty and caught but I also felt justified and annoyed. I wished I had chosen to sleep in my cold van. Then, I just decided to leave. I said, "Bye." She was miffed. I was then in a library, borrowing books. The female that was with Thea was also borrowing books. She was jealous of something. I talked to my brother Dwight. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am on an airplane. The purpose of the ride is to entertain the kids. I have a job as a "Granny"; that's where you dress up as an old woman and sit on a chair at the back of the stairs. The kids sit at bottom of stairs and talk to you. You entertain them. Then I have the makeup all over my face to look old and peek in to see someone else doing it. The kids are staring at me. I laugh and say, "I guess I look funny with all this old lady makeup on." Then it is a bus and the driver (a fat ugly woman), gets out at a rest stop. Now I'm fighting 3 men that are getting on the bus. I point to one, a young good-looking man, and call him Satan. They are evil and I must protect myself by killing them. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Ginny is helping me fix up/clean up my house. Will S comes in. We like each other. He starts to caress me and we initially agree, non-verbally, to make love. We take off our clothes and lay on the dining room table. At first, I am concerned because he's an older man and I think maybe he won't feel good, but he's strong and sensual and the experience is very enjoyable. It lasts a long time. There are interruptions. Ginny and her two sons come in and talk to me. We stop making love and I tell her to go away now. She looks hurt and wants to stay. I gently ask her to leave for awhile. Her sons are fighting. Will S tells them how to get along. Then a candle is burning near us. My mother appears and says, "Here, I'll move that, it can burn the wood, or your hair." I say firmly, "Here, give me back the candle," and firmly put it back where I want it. She looks hurt and looks around for something to straighten or fix. She leaves. Will S and I continue. I feel embarrassed because it is taking me so long. He understands and doesn't mind. It feels good. [BL]]]></report>

Several women are laughing an sneering at me, like I'm stalling and trying to destroy the tape. A Rolls Royce comes and stops by me. A lot of people get out. The star (like Mickey Rooney), gets out. He comes to me and we kiss. His show comes through town every so often and he sees me then and then leaves. His entourage sneer at me. We go for a walk. We kiss. Then he says, "Sorry babe, time to leave now," he goes away, and then he comes back for the next visit. That is our relationship. He asks me how I've been. He asks me if I have practiced and if I'm walking better. I say, "Sure." Then he starts to say goodbye and leaves and then he turns and comes back. He says, "No, I'm staying. We'll stay together. You'll practice and I'll make sure." I'm pleased and not pleased all at the same time. I get what I asked for and now not sure that's what I want. [BL]]]></report>

I have a Jay cat (a cousin of mine). She has Mama cat. Jay cat looks up at me, and asks if Papa cat is coming on the trip, I say, "No, but Mama cat is. We'll have a good time." Then I point out my new "jivin'" hair cut. I choose to drive the rest of the way to give Shannon a rest. I carry the suit cases. I think maybe we'll take a different route this time.

He knows I'm masquerading and is intrigued by me. There are some ruffians and he saves me from them and suggests I travel with him. I go to get my worldly possessions. I live in an attic room of a big tall building. I go up many flights of stairs. As I am running up the stairs, I feel a mild earthquake. I mutter over and over, "The bricks, the bricks on the roof." I am afraid. Apparently my father or some man had been killed by bricks falling off the roof. We get to the roof. I see bricks falling and a man falling. I grab my duffle bag of clothes and run down the flights of stairs. Out on the street, we get on horses to ride away. This man feels empathy for me and will protect me. [BL]]]></report>

There's a male bully that challenges me. I get a new angle for my left angle, RA leaves, I jog to build up muscle tone. The Section 8 juice is light cider with a couple teaspoons of Section 9, which is hard cider. I practice hard. At the last day of class, I shoot a perfect bull's eye with a pump rifle and then with a 30-30. I drink twice as much Section 8 as anyone else. Everyone is amazed at my prowess. I'm proud. I wake up with the words "And the light follows." Oh, I just remembered that as I was practicing jogging, I ran past the old house in M City. It had been removed so that there was space and light for a small, cute, cozy apartment for an old lady. As I ran by, I peeked in the windows. There was no kitchen, because someone else did her cooking. I saw a pretty Afghan, multi-colored, and a rocking chair, a single bed, with lots of lovely windows. I thought, "Well, when she dies, they can put in a kitchen so the unit will be reusable." [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Going to the beach. I'm walking through a large building to get to it. Howard is taking care of the baby. I feel guilty as I walk away to go to the beach and enjoy myself. I see an old player piano and want to show it to co-worker Josh, but it has no piano rolls to put in. I'm disappointed. There is a "player guitar." I play it. It has pretty music. I walk over and around lots of things to get to the side door to go out. I get lost in the corridors. I have shop lifted a couple of kitchen items, a potato peeler, and a salt shaker my daughter Dovre made. I feel embarrassed. I hope I don't get caught. I wonder why I did it?! A woman employee in a blue shop clerk jacket walks by and I hide the items. I look for directions. I see a sign that says "beds, l hotels go to heaven." I go out to the beach. I step over a stove (kitchen), that has an oil painting on it. I stand near the ocean. I see Dovre and Ellie playing in the waves. They are older, more developed physically. I envy their pretty young breasts. I put Paulina (maybe 2 or 3 years old), on my shoulders "like a dad would" and walk out. The water is shallow for a long way. Paulina wants to go out further. I look up and see a big wave coming. I turn and walk back hurriedly, explaining to the girls that we are in danger from the delayed wave that is so big. We make it back in time. [BL]]]></report>

I guess it would be O.K. as long as I don't have to live on the 4th floor. People who apply late usually get the 4th floor, but if there's an elevator, then it would be O.K." My friend then goes to the center of the bus and announces that I will play a song. I'm embarrassed. I get in front of everyone and need to readjust my instrument. I glue some cardboard together and cut some down to size. I use cottage cheese as a glue. I hide my work from the audience because they will have to guess the answer to the game. Then I try to play my banjo. It doesn't sound right. Finally, I notice that the cap is on incorrectly and the instrument is backwards and looks like a guitar. I look reprovingly at my friend and tell her she put the 4 on backwards for the caps. I fix it and then I can play the banjo. [BL]]]></report>

He grabs me and starts to rape me. I get very angry and beat the shit out of him. I lose control and hit and hit and hit. He goes away. The women's center decides to assist me even though I've not been technically raped, i.e. because of no actual penetration. I want to be alone but they all crowd into my office. I'm glad I don't have to worry about being pregnant. Now I go to another office. I have a 3 month old baby. The agency comes. A woman takes the baby. It's a happy experience. They give me a newborn, my new charge to love and nurture for 3 months or until it gets adopted. I sadly kiss the older baby goodbye and happily receive the new one. It's sleeping, so I put in on a chair by my desk to sleep. A young man comes to talk. He's quite surprised when I tell him I've had many, many children and then explain that I don't actually birth them. They're from the adoption agency. [BL]]]></report>

One person comes and sniffs it to see if it's potent and starts to walk away with it without paying for it. I feel helpless; I want to stop them but I'm afraid to. Another person goes after them and asks for the money. I'm glad they did it. The person refuses to pay and gets arrogant. "So what are you going to do about it?" I pick up a small revolver and shoot the person in the neck. I feel badly but I feel better when I realize that it's a small bullet and will hurt them, but not kill them, .22 caliber. He gives us back the stuff. The one who went after the money feels sad because we'll always be in trouble or uptight because we're dealing with stuff others will always try to take away from us. I say, "No, that's silly! We can sell this, take the money and invest it, and let the money work for us." Then the mother of one of us comes for dinner. We hide the stuff and camouflage the gun. I put a tape cassette over it. The "mom" brings a good-looking young man. Someone cooks the dinner. Each serving is a lovely bouquet of cut flowers. It's too pretty to eat. I'm glad I've already eaten my dinner. [BL]]]></report>

Bruce is also. They are favorably impressed. I say, "It's time to begin," and then I start to say, "You need to..." Ethan smiles and says, "Aren't I ever gentle?" He says just before I do, "Yes, with gentle people." [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[It is Friday at 20 of 6. I am packing my briefcase to go home after a long week. I'm standing up. I see Dana coming towards my office. I feel tired and annoyed. I think, "Where's Andrea?," and I realize she's gone home and can't be reached by phone. I see I'm the only one around to help. I sigh. He comes in, sits down and sighs. He tells me how depressed and lonely he is and how he's thinking of suicide again. I resent his clinging to me emotionally. I guess he feels that he gets to talk out of the office. He says that he'll go now and maybe find someone else or maybe kill himself. I really get annoyed now because he's playing a manipulative game. I firmly yell down the hall, "Get back here! I'll work with you for 25 minutes. Quit playing these games! If you continue playing them, I'll wash my hands of you and you can do what you will with your life." He comes back angry at me. He wants sex. I say, "No, I don't want to." He says I'm mean, that I have no feelings and that I don't care for him. I say, "I care for you as a human being. I'll hug you, but that's all." He grabs me hard like he'll never let go. I hug him, truly feeling care for him. Then I release him and send him on his way. I' feeling food! I'd done what I could and left room and energy for me. I said no to a "stray kitten!" [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in my wheelchair, looking for a place to park near the theatre so I won't have to walk far. It's very crowded and I end up far away. I see an attendant, sort of a mechanic and chew him out because there is no disabled parking. He has an arrogant look on his face. He says, "Are you one of those hippie type trouble makers?" I look at him with some contempt and say, "I am a counselor here at XXX." He is very impressed. He offers to escort me there. As we walk together, arm in arm, he smiles and asks me out. I think, "He's only a mechanic, but it might be fun to go out for awhile." Then I find out that the person that is scheduled to play the Queen in the play can't, and I am to do it. I have an hour before curtain. Marti S tells me to make frowny faces to the sounds people make. We're all sitting at a table. I do so. One woman thinks I'm pretty strange. I'm nervous. I don't even know the story line much less the words! Marti S says, "No problem, you'll do fine," and then goes away. I wait for her but she doesn't return. Howard is the director of the play. I tell him I'm not ready. He says, "Sure you are." He has confidence in me and doesn't do anything to help me. I get a 12 hour extension. I then realize that I have the Queen characterization down very well, I just need to memorize the words. I feel that I can succeed. I wear a black ornate lacy dress and a wig. I am very regal.

I dance first with one good-looking man, then with the next and then with the next. There are 3 that are the best that I am interested in. One is blond.

			<report><![CDATA[I'm going to see a movie. I see some chairs downstairs. I follow Juliet down the stairs. The stairs are clogged with coats, large art-type books, and people. I try not to step on the people. We chat as I go by. Then I look for a comfortable chair. I find one in the back. I ask Jock to carry it more forward so I can see better. He does. I find a pitcher of beer in my hand. Someone comments on it as I go by. I notice I don't have glasses. I make a joke and wonder why I have a pitcher (which the person called a vase). After all, I don't drink. Jock has 2 glasses. I say, "Leave it to you to think of the glasses." I ask his help in setting up the chair. It's just a bit too big for the small space and tips over the stair edge when I try to sit. I see wheelchair tires next to the stair edge that the feet of my chair are resting on. Jock says, "You know, I usually hold you back until you get all the facts (when he's giving me a client). I'm a little surprised and annoyed. He then is surprised at me and says, "I misunderstood you. I thought, you know, you said about alcohol and drugs and those guys you'd pick up on and I thought you didn't like people like that and wouldn't be good at helping them, so I didn't send any of them to you." I am surprised. [BL]]]></report>

There is a young couple that can't afford the rent. She's willing to cut the rent in half if others are willing to help raise the rest of the money. They ask me to donate. I hem and hah and finally agree to chip in 1 dollar. My daughter Dovre agrees to add some change. Then the girls go out to collect more money. We take it and some food to a gathering. I am thinking, "Maybe I'll keep my dollar since it was my girls that raised the money," but I feel shamed and cheap and leave it in. At the gathering, there are lots of people. A principal of the school asks me to compare my daughter's school with my own. I say, "There's not much to compare. There was the 1950's and now there's the 1980's but they are blended together. They are the same in many ways!" It's time to leave, I can't find my shoes, or the bowl the fruit came in. Then we find both. Out in the street, a strange looking midget walks by. As I go into a house, I hear Dovre calling for her dad piteously like he's drunk and lost in the neighborhood. [BL]]]></report>

I do so somewhat hesitantly. I stay near the pool edge and Dovre stays by to rescue me if necessary. We get out of the pool/lake. It's fairly crowded. We start to walk down the street. I have trouble walking because my both legs are in one pant leg, like in my mermaid suit. I kind of shuffle, hop along. Then it changes to normal and I walk. I notice a Christmas parade is coming down the street. It's colorful and noisy. We stop to watch it go by. My grandparents (Agnes & Clyde) are there and so is Aunt Esther. The parade is sort of happening through their living room. There are lovely, yellow, lemon-smelling candles. She sure has a lot of candles; her kids must be at that age. Grandma Agnes quarrels about a duck bowl. Rochelle is sitting on a piece of furniture doing a commercial. Half-way through, she runs out of things to day and hops down. I am annoyed at her. She finds a book and asks me to explain it to her. I start teaching about saying yes to a scene and not giving up. She seems to be interested. [BL]]]></report>

I offer to pay for the expensive deposit on the meds and they say no! No problem because they can collect it back later. [BL]]]></report>

I say, "It's my policy not to go out with anyone here." Then I sit down at a table. I am sandwiched between two men, one is the one I refused. I start wondering why I turned him down, aware that it scares me to think of going out with someone. I leave. The other man follows me. He likes me and I am attracted to him. He doesn't ask me anything. He just engages me in conversation and I enjoy being around him. [BL]]]></report>

I feel sad and curious and frustrated. Then we go downstairs to see his family. I see a list of what each son got on his 15th birthday. They get $1000 or a car. Both sisters got a party. I didn't think it was fair. I notice they have remodeled their house. We go upstairs, passing another stairway going down. I am intrigued but don't go there.

A small baby girl is being naughty and talking. A church member spanks her. I tell her to stop it, she is only making matters worse. I pick up the girl and hug her. She says "It's so hard to grow up," and I sigh, "I sure know what you mean." Then I put her down and we singing leaders march around singing. We stop. A black church group across the street teases us. The minister looks at our sexy evening dresses and yells, "What are you trying to do, make us throw a "mock" fit?" One woman is in a red "hooker" dress, another in a blue one. I'm in lacy white. [BL]]]></report>

The baby would tell me to lay her under the water so she can push a button while no one looks. I let her do that and pull her out seconds before she runs out of oxygen. Finally, I protest. She assures me she's o.k. I put my hand down there and push the button myself secretly. Then the baby and I must escape. We hide in the movie crowd. Dora and Willie are there and we agree to sit together. My round chair is sort of a wheelchair. A German general spies around. [BL]]]></report>

I see a dirt road and squeal on to it quickly. I hide in the trees. I see them slow up and look for me. I see a cotton men's plaid shirt tacked to a tree. They leave, I escape in a roll of dust. Now I am swimming in a terribly treacherous white water river. I barely make it after crashing over a water fall. I creep up over the bank to safety. I go back to the prison and sneak down the stairs hoping no one sees me. I see chickens in the cells. I make it to the front office and bravely walk straight for the front door. No one stops me. I stop myself and ask them if they remember me. The guard resting on a bunk is surprised. So is the woman clerk. I hear the news that if I don't qualify for a boxing match by 3:00 that day, I'll be locked up forever. I am trapped. I get on my knees and beg the guard to take the necessary papers over so I can qualify in proxy. I weep passionately. He relents and goes. Then a pox from mice sweeps the prison and all the inmates turn to shorn sheep. If I can't get out in time for the match, I'm doomed. One of the sheep baaing notices I haven't changed. I point out that I must have had it before or am immune. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am a maid of honor at a wedding. The colors are black and white. A black curvaceous 1950's dress and long white veil. I walk up the aisle and notice the groom isn't there. He then enters from a side door. Part of the ceremony is for the groom to describe the future. He's a little embarrassed. He takes his ribbons and artfully waves them around and tells how they will be married for a number of years and then he'll fall in love with another woman and leave. He shrugs his shoulders and looks sheepish. He asks her if she's willing to continue, knowing that. She says yes. The bouquets are black flowers and ribbons. The next step of the ceremony is for everyone to light a small candle and, while singing, put their flame into the common or larger flame of the bride. I light my candle and follow the bride, singing, realizing with embarrassment that the song is "Rashneeshee" and my parents are probably shocked. I like the symbolism of all our little lights coming together in one large light. I drip my candle wax in the bowl. She smiles and points out it made a crooked pattern. [BL]]]></report>

He suggests we join the others in the boat. He and I get in a row boat with a small motor on it. I ask, "Are we going further out?" He says, "No. We're just going around the corner." We go around and head for a narrow cement chute that was filled with sand, not water. We slide down fast. I'm in the front. The front crashes on the cement barrier and curls the front of the boat up. This has improved the boat's capabilities. We get out and return to the house. Lots of people are there. Patricia is there with the Mexican Tony. They are kissing.

I feel sad because the end of the world is coming and we will all die. I call out, "I love you," and turn to go. I am a little embarrassed and say, "I suppose it's corny, but it was my last chance to say it to them." We go inside the house. My Uncle Joel calls me to the other room. I am hesitant because I'd already put my stuff in a bedroom. I go into the living room and sit on a couch. Leroy is there and there is instant attraction and warmth. He sits next to me, very close, and puts his arm around me. I know this is wrong, but I want it. I struggle with my conscience a little, but it's a foregone conclusion. He complains bitterly how he never measures up to his father's expectations. A stray kitten and a cousin. It's a double reason to stay away, but I love being near him. I feel warmth and excitement. Both Uncle Joel and he assure me they are still working on marketing my script. I am a little annoyed and frustrated. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am looking at images of what went wrong in our marriage. Lots of snapshots, interviews; I remember the color black. I am helping my bad ex-husband set up a shower. It's a lot of tall, ungainly pipes. Between us we get it set up and the cold water pours out of the shower head. I take a cold, cold shower. I am fully clothed and find a small sample bottle of shampoo in my shirt pocket. I wash my hair and arms. I feel very invigorated by the shower because it is so cold. I step out and walk jauntily past my ex-husband and all the pictures. A voice (maybe my brother, Jake) says, "Now, do me a favor. Give him the shampoo. You can work together a little bit." I realize I had selfishly kept the bottle, which had only cost 75 cents. I gave it to him. [BL]]]></report>

I couldn't imagine why I just didn't do the driving. It would be easier and safer. Jake is in the pickup as well. We are in a parking lot. We park and get out. Jake is being very apologetic and I say, "Don't over help." They go ahead and I try to catch up. I call out, "Sandy." I'm in an intersection. A crowd is gathering. There is some ceremony where money is being given to a disability cause. I see Lucy and Jake and then I am crowded in by many, many tall men. I look around and exclaim, "So tall! It's not fair!" They can see well. I'm all smashed up against some guy's beige polyester suit. Cameras are everywhere. They can't see me I'm so crowded in. Some man says,"Where do we donate?" And a man says, "It's already been done." The money's here already and I notice I'm standing right at the center of the attention where a round baseball is. The crowd has suddenly thinned out. The cameras are gone. The excitement is over. [BL]]]></report>

The wife of the restaurant owner wants our opinion. I want to leave and go home. The "games" there are uncomfortable. First I'm going to shampoo my hair. I am in a room and a man watches. I use too much shampoo and spill it into a small container. Now Elizabeth Taylor is taking a bath. A man in a leather jacket comes in, opening 3 wallets with credit cards and money. He says, "This is what I offer. All you have to give is you." I'm a little disgusted and want Elizabeth to leave but she doesn't want to. So I leave. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Some woman is annoyed with me because she gave me some information and I didn't get it back to her. I agree to get it for her. I get the papers and remember I was going to xerox it first -- it's a lot of information on music. I take it to a xerox machine. An office worker wants to know if I've been watching Hank because he has refused to make a copy of what he was supposed to copy. I say, "No, I haven't." Hank walks in and I say, "Hi Hank," to alert the other woman not to talk about him. I try to xerox. It is hard. There is a lot to copy. I ask Jock to help me. He does. Then I have to go to my dorm room to get more knitted clothes that belong to the woman. We pass a busy military-like man who has helicopter-like machine displays. Get to my room and Jock/Abner gets the clothes, sometimes getting my own clothes almost mixed up with the others. I look up at the ceiling and say, "What happened to my ceiling?" It has ribbon bows on it and the asbestos is on it. It's a mess. Someone explains, but I don't remember the reason. [BL]]]></report>

I feel sad and know it will be sadder over the next few days. I go to get my car, which is broken. There are two, a van and a spiffy car. I think, "I can't use the car because my chair won't fit in." The mechanic is busy and tells me he can't fix it yet and gives me a reason. I tell him I need it because Howard died and that is a stronger reason. He doesn't care. I then remember there will be an inheritanc, but I will have to fight for it. I think, "I'll use the inheritance to get a degree in psychology, another two years of school." I sit in a chair like the swim lift chair and want it to go forward, but someone set the brakes and it tries to go forward like a train (chug chug chug chug) and folds over itself and is broken.

So I walk to the kitchen and look out the back window and see her grooming her horse. I remember she loved that horse and must be feeling sad to leave it. A phone rings and she tells one of the kids to be sure and answer it. I realize that I will be able to talk to her if she comes in to get the phone. I walk toward the phone in the living room. Lucy comes in,; she is naked. She gets up on the wooden rickety table (the only furniture left) and undoes the lamp fixture in the ceiling. There are lots of cobwebs. She tells the girls to be careful of the strings. I say, "I know you're busy, but could you tell me, in a nutshell, what made you do this? Just a few months ago, you were not going to have him and now you're gone." [BL]]]></report>

A doctor comes over and says, "Don't move," and sticks pins in me. I realize I don't feel them. I say, "Oh no! Don't tell me it's my spine." He says, "Maybe not. Sometimes things are numb for a while." The man that ran over me comes to the emergency room as I'm being wheeled in on a stretcher. He says, "I was drunk." I am furious and scream at him that he ought to be hung up by his balls upside down for 100 years. That would teach him a lesson. I am livid. His father says, "We'll talk about this when you calm down." I then have to walk slowly up some difficult stairs to the emergency room. They see me and come running to help me up the last stair. A black woman is there and the nurse jokes about her color being a permanent tan. The black woman says someday people won't be afraid and will treat me normally. [BL]]]></report>

I choose one that's lacy and pretty, but hard to get on her. We struggle getting her hand in the arm and finally succeed. Then I take off her messy diaper and clean her up. She shits when I don't have a diaper on her. I clean that up, shuddering. Now my mother says, "Give the baby to me and you count all this money on my bed." I see piles and piles of coins (change). Most of them are foreign currency. What a tiring task. I say, "I'd rather hold the baby. I haven't had a chance to." She says, "Later, you can do it later." I sigh and start working on the money. Then I'm helping a woman pack. There are lots of snap shots laid out on the bed, some of Willie, some of her lover. I am concerned that her husband will come in and find out! I try to gather them up. Then I must hurry and I choose the shoes to pack, discarding several "Baby Jane" shoes for little girls. [BL]]]></report>

I am apologizing that I don't have much content information. I go to the library to find an encyclopedia to get more information. I'm going to show maps and talk about how the fires burn off all the old tangled growth that leaves room for new growth. Then, as we are going to the classroom, the thing shifts and we are now going to a cafe, De Frisco's, to reminisce on the Germany Trip with 3 or 4 other women. We sit around a table. I suggest another member of the Germany group show her pictures. But just before she starts, I pull mine out and start with the Palace of Versailles. I find as I start talking, I have lots to say and it is interesting to the others. Then we decide to play baseball. I hit a ball and run for first base and was nearly "put out." The base was real close. Then I show someone a lovely wooden panel I was allowed to bring back from Paris. It fit on top of a piano we had here. Then we had to move a table that had pretty things on it back to make more room for second base. The table leg slipped and some things fell. We decided we'd meet again to finish our talks as we'd already been there 4 hours. I wrote the names of the ones who will speak and in what order. I consulted with Rena who said she would do her talk if she'd had enough to drink. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a house and it is crowded with lots of things and furniture. A small bird and a large blow fly come rushing in. I think it's a bee but someone reassures me it's a fly. There is a mask in a basket with a lid. I give it to a small boy and he takes it outside and dumps the old, musty, moldy mask. I feel relief. Suddenly the house is nearly empty. Lots of space. Only a stove moved in from a rental (our original old stove) and a table are left and I like it this way. The boy brings back the empty basket and I almost accept it back, but change my mind and give him the basket. I don't want it because it carries the odor and feel of the mask. I am outside. Two guys are up a telephone pole fixing the lines. They are hanging up there in a way that seems impossible, but they seem comfortable. One is there to "spot" the other guy in case he gets in trouble. They finish and come down the ladder and efficiently pack up their equipment. It was very graceful; each knew how to do each task and they just did whatever was closest at hand. I ride my wheelchair around their truck watching them and then I go to my front door and park the chair and walk in. [BL]]]></report>

A man and I are rehearsing a video promo on disability awareness. I do a cheerful, charming rap. Some people come in. We are talking about relationships. I am dancing alone and enjoying dancing to the music. I start to join another woman dancing alone, but then chose to dance alone. Then this man and I discuss what kind of relationship to experiment with. He says "good friend and boyfriend first." Another guy and I laugh and say, "Wouldn't it be better to start with an educational relationship and then move to girl/boy friend and then to marriage?" I grimace at the idea of marriage.

"Nice neighborhood," I say sarcastically. The bridge becomes a stairway in a high-rise office building. At first we are going down to leave the building, but then we change and are going up to get to the protection of his father's office. I am glad because then our relationship has a chance. The furniture is rich and lovely. We sit in the dining room. Later, a secretary shows us where the spare blankets and rollaway bed is, only now we're stuck with her. She has three pink poodles, one a male. We laugh at how silly they look! Then, there's a whole crowd of people with us. I remember the lights are on and maybe someone outside has noticed and will come rescue us. I am embarrassed that I'd not thought to flash the lights to signal for help (I am aware I really didn't want help). The elevator now starts to work, but breaks down again. Everyone else uses the elevator. I hang back hoping to be last, with him. [BL]]]></report>

I see bushes across the road burning and her front garden and lawn has been flooded. The water hose is still on. I say, "Those vandals I heard about on the news were here! I'd best call the police. They've ruined your garden." She goes out to look. I call the police. I dial "0" and ask for the police. They are on the line very quickly. I say, "My name is Barb Sanders and I'm at...." "Hey," I yell to her, "What's your address here?" She tells me and I tell them. Then I describe the damage. I say, "You can even see their footprints." I hang up and wait for them. Then I hear her out there cleaning up the mess. I go out and say, "Don't do that. You'll ruin the evidence. You'll cover it up." I am concerned. I decide to go home. She gives me the tape of our session and says, "Don't work on this tonight. You've worked hard enough today." I say "OK. Maybe I'll just listen to it once." I smile because I realize I still intend to work on it. Then I look around for my car. I can't see it anywhere. I say, "Wouldn't I have parked it close to the house, so I wouldn't walk so far?" She walks up the side yard to look. I say, "Wait! Now when the police get here all they'll see is yours and my footprints!" [BL]]]></report>

People are sitting on the stairs and I have to walk over them carefully. Now we are at a meeting and a friend gets voted in to a special office of importance. I get voted in to a new office. They've been waiting for someone with the proper skills to show up. A writer. I get to be historian, or scrap book person. I'm not too thrilled. Then Rita and I walk to the beach down a steep path. I look out across the ocean and I see huge waves and a heavy, threatening sky. A bad storm is coming. We are concerned about some of our group who are out on boats. Will they get back safely? I pick up some of Rita's vials and eye drop things (German Rita who is visually impaired). I don't get them all. I go back to the huge dorm-like house. The group meets. Ellie and Paulina are in swimsuits and want to go down to a little swim. I say, "No. It's too dangerous." They are hard to convince, but they return with us. The male leader says, "It's confirmed. It's SAM (the name of the hurricane.) They're even breaking out the canoes in New England. It's a big one. So get inside. Be prepared. We'll survive it. I ask if we have enough food to last.

I say, "That's silly. Why did they do it that way?" Dolores has very heavy makeup on her face. She's here to interpret for the deaf. As I am standing, talking to her, two or three men of color, one black, one or two Native Americans, crowd around me very close. The black man is softly kissing my neck from behind. The Native American man is to my right, talking softly. Another stands some distance from us, but he and I are talking with our eyes and occasionally words. Now I'm seated in the front row. A show of some kind (fashion perhaps) will soon begin. I see a baby and ask to hold it. His blankets are all wrinkled up, so I lay him down on the floor to straighten the blanket up. I end up with the baby in a metal box that cramps the baby's legs up. I hold the baby to my chest and am concerned if it can breathe because the metal lid has closed. I open it some and say, "Boy, this baby sure doesn't like this!" I feel a little sorry I'd gotten it in this predicament. [BL]]]></report>

Then I go downstairs and We and my mother play 'wait til you see his new girlfriend' (Jake/Nate's cousin). I go to the kitchen door and she's there looking pouty and cute. "Where's Whoopie?" she lisps. I laugh and look in at my mother and Lydia. "She's here," I giggle. "Is Whoopie anywhere?" I accept her way of lisping. My mother whispers to me, "Be careful! She's powerful." I laugh and lead her upstairs to find "Whoopie." She follows arrogantly, telling where she'll put her things. She looks older now, maybe 50, 55. Then Jake runs past saying hurriedly, "It's almost time for the Royal." We all run after him. Now we're like in India and the royal procession is approaching and we must be at our appointed place in time before the King arrives. One man calls our "Elephant" and doesn't even stop running as he hops up on a running elephant. He sways as he rides. We arrive at the stairs and are nearly too late. But protocol says that pushy women must go first. "Hurry! You first," says Jake. She just grins and refuses. "Now we're in trouble! If she won't go, we can't go and then the King will be upset!" I say, "Let me talk to her!" Jake says, "No, I'll take care of it." He pulls out his penis and twists it so that a hand rolled cigarette comes out of the end of his penis! He's going to sit and smoke it until he thinks of a solution. I am a little disgusted at the idea of putting it in his mouth as it will be a little slimy from the sperm! [BL]]]></report>

His eyes flutter and I think he's going, and then he wakes up and tells me more memories. He especially focuses on one weekend we shared together, something about the M City house. He says it was this room before it was remodeled and I look and realize it was the original room. He'd made a mistake. It was the old pool table room, only empty of furniture. [BL]]]></report>

I pull the covers up around me and say, "What are you doing?" He's shy but insistent. He wants to make love, to get closer to me. He tries to kiss me. I am annoyed. I certainly don't want to make love to this wimp; what nerve! I say, "No. We can't. I'm your supervisor and it isn't ethical." I then think he'll be hurt, so I say, "I admire your courage to get naked and come here asking, but I don't want this." Just then through an open window I see people leaning out of their windows in the hotel across the street yelling, "Happy New Year" and blowing horns. I look at the clock and, sure enough, it's a few minutes past 12. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am a teenager and some guy is joining us, but I don't trust him. Our teacher, Gary, calls us together and asks us, "What do you think of this new guy? Does he seem a little sleazy or not "true" to you?" "Yeah!" we agreed. I say, "He doesn't feel right, like he lies." "Yeah," says Gary. "Well, what if I just flat out say, 'No booze or drugs'? That would take care of the scotch problem right there. It's tough, but real." We agreed. Paulina says, "But he might have a problem getting back in with his friends. If he's a flirt, then he won't fit in any more." I think it's interesting that a lesbian is concerned that a drunk be able to continue his noisy, flirty, sexist ways. I disagree and start talking about if his attitude is OK, he can fit in and still have fun even if he's off the booze and drugs. As I'm talking, suddenly little lights zip up to me and surround me. I look up at Gary startled. I realize these are aliens that are taking me away, and as I start rising (still in cross-legged, seated position), I yell, "Gary!" And then I yell, Goodbye!" I see them all staring at me in astonishment and sadness. I feel a little scared and sad as I see the tree as I rise up and up. (I suddenly wake up relieved I wasn't disappearing into the cosmos.)

I see an ugly man there and say, "Uh oh, guess I shouldn't have opened the door." I shut it quickly. I decide I don't want this room to be so bad, so I marshal my forces and change things. (I am aware I'm dreaming) and command the bugs to straighten things up. They march around in lines and I walk carefully so as not to smash any of them. I am repelled by them and grateful to them. They do miraculous work. In fact it is lovely and has opened up into more rooms, including the room the man had been in. I go down a hallway toward the bedrooms. I see video games. Then I see a 3-D video behind glass of real people enacting ordinary human activities. I'm like a voyager watching them. I feel sad that I'm reduced to such a lowly act. I see sexual activity and feel an orgasm. [BL]]]></report>

The woman teacher is there and I ask her if she would mind if I could be an assistant director. She says, "How will this help?" I start counting on my fingers how it would help. "First, for me," I say and I pause and repeat it because it felt selfish to say for me first. But I decide it is proper and I say, "For me, I would gain skills and experience. For you, after I learn blocking, I could run some of the rehearsals and you could have time off." "I'll have to ask the class," she says. I agree and point out one woman will say no. She doesn't like me. So I tell the class how I've married this Protestant. They ask if my father is angry. I say, "No because I divorced my Catholic family." Then a woman sadly says, "At first, he won't read your letters and then later, when he dies, he'll speak of you in his last words." She cries. "It was like that with her dad," someone says.

So I go into a bathroom and sit on a toilet and pee, and then I walk out to him and hug him, kissing him passionately and say, "Yes." He is so happy and we walk arm in arm, really connected and in love. We pass Jake and Valerie all dressed up and walking together, Jake's arm around Valerie. We are at the Hilton. I smile at them, but they don't respond. I say to my guy, "Maybe she didn't recognize me because I'm standing." She then comes back and says, "Hi." We all walk together. Jake and my guy used to work together and Jake has made it big. He gives my guy 90 (0?) percentage, which pleases him. We walk out past a display in a museum where we see Basaltic rock columns rising and falling. The narrative tells us that that's where the Killer Bees live and thank God, they are disappearing so there's less bees. I see two naked men tortured by being covered with these bees. One man opens his mouth at their command to let them in and out. He is in extreme pain. It is horrible. The bees stored honey in his nipple. I feel sick and walk away. [BL]]]></report>

A young girl walks toward us innocently. I yell at her, "Run, run and get Father. If only I can resist until Father comes to save me." The man grins and waits for me. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am walking down the corridor of a hospital and see a new born baby in his bassinet in the hall. The mother is upset and the baby is crying. I go to the baby and caress his head and send "loving" vibes to it. It calms down and sleeps. The nurses are very impressed with my ability and ask me to help out with the preemie's who may die if not nurtured. I go to the nursery and am handed a tiny baby that fits into my hands, so unformed, it's face doesn't have skin yet, just muscle and red. I lay it on my left arm and cuddle it. I concentrate all my loving energies toward it. Now the baby looks like a baby. I go to a sink and put water on my arms as that is better for the baby. I feel a need to pee, but can't leave the baby even for a moment. A nurse suggests she get me a bed pan. I try to feed the baby and suddenly it starts sucking at the thin drops of "mother's milk" I offered on a tiny tube/stick. At first I'm concerned she will choke, but she really is eating and swallowing, gaining strength. I am pleased and in awe. She's gaining weight. She is surviving! [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Third dream: I am standing on a sidewalk and a beautiful Indian man stands at my left. He's a dancer and the music is calling him. He starts to dance away and turns, smiling to invite me to dance with him. He'll teach me how to dance. As we are walking, the scene changes and we are walking into a cathedral. I think to myself, "How odd. Why am I dreaming a catholic church?" Then I notice it's a Mexican Mission. We are drawn in as a part of the crowd. We go upstairs and move to seats very close to another Indian man who is preparing his instrument. I am equally attracted to him and go closer. He has a guitar with a printer in it. Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, "Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string." It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. (I'm in the passenger seat.) I look out the window and see a two-story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears (grizzlies) starting to get out the windows. I tell my Indian man and he gets out to stop them. I see the two bears followed by a dog running away. In the sky are a helicopter and several planes. I begin to cry, left all alone in the car. I keen and lament, "I've lost everything I've ever loved." My two beautiful Indian men are gone. I weep uncontrollably. [BL]]]></report>

Grandma goes upstairs to the balcony where the women's guild is selling food. I help them. We look over the balcony rail to see the preacher giving his sermon. After church, there's a Bible study group and we are there. I feel sleepy and lean back to nap. Grandma does too and then she gets up on the back of the curved couch to lay down, like a cat would, her feet hit the face of a man in the group, she scoots over to my side. I smile to see her like that. Then I say, "It's after 2:00, can we leave pretty soon?" She agrees and I start packing up my supplies, disks, pencils, papers, to take with me. I leave six pencils that might have been the church's property, hoping I don't take their stuff with mine. We drive off. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I'm in an old run-down house. The floor boards of my bedroom are rotted through and a hole is developing. I'm in bed near a stairwell. I realize some of the clothes on my floor have slid down into the hole. I wonder where my father is. He could fix the hole. I reach for the clothes and slide into the hole myself and fall under the house in a horrible pile of debris that is rotting away. I feel fear that I will rot with it. I fight my way back up into the house and walk down the hall asking where everyone is. Dwight is in his room, the furthest one away. My mother's in her room. I'm near the front door and a monster from hell comes at me. I am very afraid but stand my ground. I grab its tongue at its roots and pull, even though I know he'll bite me and it will be terribly painful. I poke his eye with a stick and drag him out of the house. He's unconscious and I crawl back to the house with a match. I light the carpet on the porch, wondering if I should go in first and get our possessions, but it is more important to torch it at once. I light it. The monster comes at me, but is consumed in the flames. I look to make sure all my family is safely out of the house. One is missing and then I see her -  Dwight, Jake, my mother, my father, Charla and me. We walk down the road and I say, "Are we homeless? And we don't even have a car to live in." [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am approaching a barn, it is old, dilapidated and ugly. Inside is darkness and rotting, stinking stuff that I am supposed to clean up. I don't want to, and as I am walking to the door, I veer away, deciding not to do it. I then walk across a grassy pasture to a muddy embankment. I accidentally slip and fall, sliding down the embankment to a muddy area that is like quicksand. I am flat on my back and sinking, trapped and I know there is no way out. I am as good as dead. My sister Lydia is with me and she is already below the mud line. I see she is still alive because her eyes open and shut. It is almost time for me to go under. I feel fear and resistance, but I don't panic. I go under and am amazed I can still breathe. A wash of water goes over us, rising us, floating, out of the mud. We crawl out onto the grass. Then we get up, hugging each other and walking toward our house, which is around the left side of the barn. There are a series of Quonset huts like married student housing at OSU. The first one on the left is ours. It is old, the paint is peeling. I open the door and walk in. I see a blue cotton print dress on a dress form and I say, "Hi, Mama." I realize it is a symbol of my mother. I see movement in the bedroom, my "father" is sick and old and in bed. I don't want to go in, but I do. His face is bumpy and old-looking. He says to me, "I have no sons, so you will be my boy, Buck Bucko." [BL]]]></report>

I'm waiting for my boyfriend. Another man, the "bad guy," sits near me and on the arm of the chair I'm seated in, curled up in a sexy way. He moves his hand to cause my dress to fall more revealingly to show more leg. Then he sits next to me, his arm now around me. He asks me to dance. I agree. He pulls me close. I see he has a large butcher knife. I have one too. We fight like swords fighting. I feel sad, but I must defend myself. I try to knife his balls. He dodges. He's a good-looking man.

			<report><![CDATA[I am told that my sister Lydia died. I am shocked and sad. I'm sort of in shock and it takes awhile for the full feelings of sorrow to sink in. Some part of me seems removed, distant, almost objectively curious. I suddenly remember to ask my mother how she died. My mother said the four of them went to dinner at the Bates Restaurant. They all ate the same food and they all got sick, but Lydia must have eaten the worst, most poisoned part, and she died. They all threw up and had slimy, sticky diarrhea, but Lydia died from it. I shake my head in sorrow. She was so young and good and had so much to live for. Then I amend that part, living with Darryl, how could she look forward to living more? Cousin Patricia comes by to give me some photos she had of Lydia. It's tradition, when someone dies, people give back their photos to the loved one. I remember returning Terence's pictures to her.

Suddenly "my little girl" is there too and we start floundering. She goes under and I have a terrible dilemma. Do I let go of the one to save the other and endanger myself as well? I dive for her and find her. Now I'm working hard to keep all of us afloat. I see a huge rubber life raft and we get in it, only it must have a leak in it because it's very limp and water is getting in. We fold up the limp parts and I ask the girls to bail. We manage to stay afloat. We float over to an opening in the wall and I see monsters, three ugly things. They capture me and put me in a cage with it hanging over some boiling oil or black sewage gunk. If I don't choose one of these uglies to marry, they'll dump me in the gunk. I don't know which fate is worse. I decide to choose one of the uglies. [BL]]]></report>

It is coming toward me and I must protect myself or it will kill me. I have my father's .22 rifle. I shoot at the bear over and over, but it only enrages him and he's close now. I aim for the eye and shoot and shoot. Now he's on top of me, mauling me. I keep shooting and finally it dies. I crawl out from under it and crawl, bleeding and maimed, to my father's horse. I put my father's rifle in the holster on the saddle and ride back to tell my father I have killed his bear. I am worried he will be upset because I've brought to an end his favorite sport. I see a small, naked Native American man. He's out of shape and his body fat is down around the belly and hips. He tries to suck it all in and his chest rises to look more manly. [BL]]]></report>

I pass a beat-up car in the grass and think I've seen that image before. Why am I seeing it again? It must mean something. Maybe I dreamed it. Another woman and I walk past (I'm in my wheelchair) the candy section in the store. She pulls off a box and opens it. I remember we get things for free because we work there. I say, "Wait," and turn to look at the selections. I see the ice-cream section and wonder if there's any sugar-free ones. I see the cookie section. There's a machine. The boss woman put dough in it and huge, sticky rolls come out. They aren't quite done right, a bit doughy but still delicious. People are eating them. I try a bite, wondering if all that sugar will affect my irregular heart beat. The boss woman is crazy and goes off. I guess she dies. The other woman says to me, "At least I talked Sweet Liberty from walking." She felt proud of that. (Sweet liberty is a woman who is upset at the crazy boss woman and almost left.) I offer to help at the counter and the other woman says no, there's not much I can do, being disabled. All I could do would be the easy parts that everyone wants to do, like the cash register. I say, "Now don't be too hasty. Let's check it out. I might be more help to you than you think." [BL]]]></report>

A man intends to hurt me. I get out of the car and run. They chase. I go into my house and try to lock doors. I call 911 and hide under the telephone table. The woman who answers the phone is a nurse. She's impersonal and taking her time. I ask her to tell the police to come to 837 A. Street.

			<report><![CDATA[A man and a woman want to make love and are looking for a place where they can be private. A man hides in closets and the woman goes from closet to closet looking for him. She sees a boy coming to the closet to hang up his hats. This bothers her because he'll find their closet and interrupt. He goes in and is now in his own room. Three puppets are hung up on the hat rack. He's afraid of one of them because it has huge black circles for eyes and looks scary. He calls to his daddy who says there's nothing to worry about. Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a "female" and they have sex. I feel orgasm. A voice says, "That's OK, they are doing this because they are not really homosexual, they are both" (meaning bi-sexual). [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary is laying in the bathtub taking a bath. My bath chair is out and I am standing, intending to bathe standing and wondering if I'll be able to stand that long. Nancy comes in to scrub Mary's back and I sit on the toilet to have a watery bowel movement and hope it doesn't stink. I try to wipe myself and get some on my thumbnail. The sink is filled to overflowing. I rinse my thumb and continue to wipe my butt, which has streaks of it. Suddenly Mary yells, "The Clinic," and gets up and runs so fast out of the bathroom that she doesn't even bother to open the door, she goes through the door, like she's a spirit or melts through it. I comment on that to Nancy, it is so amazing. Mary comes back very upset because she was right. She just missed her clinic appointment and it was so important. She's leaving for Mexico and wanted to know what to do if she got raped and they used knives to cut the inside of her vagina. I try to be helpful and suggest she can find some books on the subject at Paralandra's. It wouldn't be the same, but maybe it would help. [BL]]]></report>

I look forward to it and pick up the sweet rolls and put them in a pan on the burner to cook through. My mother speaks to me and I can't understand her for several tries. Finally I smile and say, "OK, I'll get it, I should not have put the rolls on so soon." I try to pick them up and they come apart. It's a mess. I am aware that I'm handling this situation differently than I usually do. I am more open and willing to admit a mistake and willing to try and fix it, rather than get all stubborn in my anger and shut down or snap back. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am at a school dance with my younger sister Lydia, pretending I am her age of 13. A young man (like Nate or Larry of high school) is drawn to me and I play coquettish 13 years old. It's time to leave, and as I go down the stairs, I start to look and act a bit older (16 years or so) and he is very enticed. I wear a sweater combo like in the 1950's. He follows. I run, laughing to my car and tell Lydia to hurry. We get in and he comes to the driver's side and wants to talk. I roll the window (wet from rain) down a quarter of the way. The window is a barrier for closeness and he asks me to open it more. I slowly, flirtatiously do so until it is full open. He wants to kiss me and I want it too, but hold off because of my tender age. I tell him I'm going to Judy's house to meet friends. He could go there too. We drive away, and I go to Judy's house, without Lydia now. I greet some girlfriends and soon he comes in and asks me to dance. I agree and we begin a slow dance. He bends down to kiss me and I turn shyly away. "I'm too young yet." "All right," he says, "but don't let anyone else kiss you. Let me be the first." I promise and we dance more closely, hugging; we know we are made for each other. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am going to a bookstore and start walking, hoping to catch the bus. It's two minutes until the bus is expected. I'm on 14th street and am headed for 10th. The walking is hard going and painful. I get there. It's a conveyer belt of canned goods. A woman helps check them out. They are packaged up in plastic crates with an identifying tag so you know what's yours and where one stops and the other starts. Now I'm watching couples at a "butt watching" fair or gathering. Three couples, all dark, straight hair, dark complexion (Italian) are together. One woman is very upset and a man is trying to help her. He holds her quarters for her without taking any. She doesn't trust he has done so sand asks another woman to check for her. The other woman counts the eight quarters and the one silver dollar and hands them to me to hold for her. It's confirmed and she hugs the man. They are very close, cuddling. His arms are around her as she leans her back into his chest, then feet out in front of them, intertwined. The other woman says, "You can't do that if your not going to get married." This makes them think because they were intending to be just very good friends until she was cured and then she would go on and marry someone else. She looks over and sees the man's best friend and decides to marry him. This causes the man to turn and look long and searching into her eyes. He now wants to marry her. I think she wants it too and was using a ploy to get his attention. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I did research on a board game and played it myself to understand it. It involves movie stars. I now am sharing the game with a group of friends: Hillary of Merton Circle, Bob M of Counseling and two other women. I look up to the ceiling and see four large glass or ceramic things we'd somehow secured up there. One is a large cat ceramic (like the one on my fireplace). Another is a dog one, like a cookie jar. One is a huge red glass bowl with ornate embossed patterns on it, very Victorian and beautiful. I notice it's crooked and may fall. I am concerned because we are seated right under it. In the game, there is a MaMa card and a Doctor card. There are four categories to choose from. One is a picture of a young girl (7-8 years old) fleeing from a woman, perhaps in Indian (eastern) dress or early 1900's dress. The theme is the girl was hurt very badly by her mother. I don't remember the other three categories. I see Ginger Rogers seated near the board. She is one of the women in the group, and I say, "You were my mother in a movie. I'm not surprised you don't remember, I had forgotten too." Now I'm having trouble remembering how to play the game and it is getting boring. I fold it up like an accordion credit card holder, wondering why I thought it was such a good game. [BL]]]></report>

I am distracted from writing when I glance out the window and see how very blue the water is and I think I see a seal. But it is two black dogs sitting in a shrub tree. Then I see penguins and gulls all over. I realize it is the rocky surf and not yet the ocean I am looking at. The ocean is much further out. It is low tide. I then realize I'll never get my writing done if I spend all my time gazing at my ocean. The one man and I are a team helping each other as we write and co-writing the thing.

I feel better having it full now. I get in my red car with a floor stick shift and start to drive. I turn the corner to the left and squeal out, liking the good way the car is running. I feel pleased that I have three running cars now and Howard doesn't have as much. I feel a bit sorry for him, and as I drive I realize he wants to talk to me and wonder what it's about. I am feeling a bit superior about being better off than Howard. Then I remember I still live with my parents and feel embarrassed because I should at this age be out on my own. Even though I need someone to live in and help me, I could do that with a roommate. That would be more adult than relying on my parents. [BL]]]></report>

I feel tired, but it is my duty to teach her the more disciplined way of not barging in other people's conversations. I go get her and bring her back. She is not happy about that. Soon I see that she has gone again and I get up and retrieve her again. I feel tired, but know this is the only way to assist her to get along better with others. Later, we are in our apartment. I am in a dining area and a big living room adjoins it. There is also a bedroom space where my bed is and another open space where her bed is. I walk into the bedroom area and see it's really a barn. There is a layer of hay on the floor and the whole end wall is missing and open to the outdoors. I am surprised and repeat to myself, "I live in a barn." I go back to the dining area and then feel danger. I know the elevator is going to crash through the ceiling. At first I think it is the girl that lives above us dancing too much or something. I look up and see a square and then it opens up and an open elevator crashes through with two people on it, one a boy and the other a huge fat woman. It smashes the couch and I am relieved to know I or the little girl wasn't sitting there or we'd have been smashed. [BL]]]></report>

There are some other disabled people in the audience but mostly they are ab's. There is a large empty floor space between the first row of audience and the stage. On the stage is a group of men playing rock music. One is particularly attractive. He says he will kiss one of the disabled people. I go up quickly to the edge of the stage and he comes down on the floor and picks me up in a lavish body dancing dip posture and exaggerates a kiss. I play along dramatically. As we finally kiss, I realize he is wearing a wooden mask with a small hole for the mouth and he "tongues" me through the hole. He whispers his apology and says that later we will really kiss. I feel frustrated, but try my best to kiss real good. Our tongues touch. I go back to my seat. Now the group resets up their stage setting on the floor right in front of me. They have a play they will do and create fold-out sets and costumes in a wardrobe, within a foot of where I sit. I am excited I will get to see things so close. He asks how many disabled there are in the audience. They yell or raise their hands. There are a few. I change to my power wheelchair to dance with him. [BL]]]></report>

I start to go downstairs but she says, "No, let's do it the easy way, and put the phone on hold and dial 86, the extension." She does so and we wait. I see Lionel walk past the door across the hall and don't call out to him. We wait some more. Naomi calls again, number 85. She goes out. I start to move the bed myself. It was pretty easy. I almost get it in the right position but now I wait some more. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[We are told to line up around the room and start on the bottom shelf of books. It's a book sale and we are all grabbing the books we want to buy. Someone on my left grabs a book in my section, I say, "I already have it, it's OK," and move on. Now I see a display of glass pretties. Someone exchanges the little glass pitcher or creamer with another one that matches the bowl already there. It's like my mother's cranberry sauce bowl, glass rounded ribs. I say, "Very nice, but probably more expensive and too big to be in scale." I go on. I remember to look for a video camera case to fit my video camera and ask a man. He is condescending and looks for an ordinary case. I am annoyed. Can't he see? I say, "If you would just look at MY camera, you would see it is a more complex and advanced camera." I am annoyed he doesn't realize I'm quite good at this and not just average or a beginner. [BL]]]></report>

Something about Grandma Mildred. We forgot something, maybe the key to the house, and she goes back to get it. I sit,waiting, and then realize I have the key and we can go in to wait for her return. I get out and try to find the key in my purse. I finally find it. A girl comes by with a note from Grandma. A man reads it and sighs, I might have known to not send her.

Then I see a cardboard box and realize a baby is in there. I pull off layer after layer of cardboard some with writing on it from the baby's mother, I finally find the baby in a plastic molded container like she was a doll. I take her out and feel immense relief for her. I hold her and kiss her and hug her, knowing she had a very traumatic time in the dark and want her to feel loved and whole. She has short cute blonde hair and wears a blue jammie. She is happy and not badly traumatized by her experience. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Marci is noisy and bothersome. She won't stop talking and I am very upset. My friends Mirabelle and Lucy (maybe Rochelle as well) agree to kill her for me. It seems the only way to shut her up. I hesitantly agree. I want her to stop, but I feel squeamish about doing it myself. So they shot her with a gun and she falls. Now we have to get rid of the body, but I notice she's not dead yet. She's still breathing. One of my friends puts her on my bed while she goes looking for something to finish her off with. I feel real dread at being so close to her. She stares out vacantly, breathing. I feel sick, being so near her. I start to feel remorse. First she felt ill anyway, and now we've added the pain of a bullet and blood. Someone suggests we give her an overdose of pain killers so she'll be free of the pain and finally die. I agree and then I feel bad and decide it's best to turn ourselves in with her so she can get help. It was wrong to try to kill her. I agree to take the full blame and I say I will tell the authorities that I killed her and shot the gun myself. That way my friends won't get in trouble for trying to help me. They don't know what to do. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Paulina (my daughter) and I are invited to come to a ceremony for the children by a Native American man. We agree and think it will be very interesting. We are looking forward to it. Unbeknownst to me, the man wants to marry me and is setting up this ceremony to camouflage the wedding ceremony. So Paulina and start walking and soon find ourselves out in a desert area like near M City. No one else is around and the road seems unmarked. We wonder if we are in the right place. I look back and see the dirt road and some people coming out way far back. So I know we are just ahead of everyone else. We continue on. Then we see some wooden houses, white man buildings, and realize that in order to make us comfortable, they have built this little village. We look at each building and admire it. They are cute. Now the Native American man comes to me and suggests I sit with the children during the ceremony rather than in the bleachers with the audience. I agree. He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, "Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first." I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins.

			<report><![CDATA[I am on stage, as a sort of stage manager, in C City. A little black girl is going to do ballet and tap dancing. She does the ballet and the audience loves it, although it is a redneck audience and usually doesn't care for this sort of thing. I think some rough man kind of forced them to be there, because he wanted the girl to have an audience. Just before the show, I had looked through the curtains to see only a few people seated up front and to the left side. There is a short intermission for the girl to change into her tap shoes. The time gets longer and the audience gets restless. I think, "I'd better do some Evangeline if this keeps up." She comes back, but she doesn't want to dance now. She says her tummy is upset and she had to go to the bathroom and maybe she'll dance, maybe she won't. I say, "Then I need to know. Take one minute to decide. Either way it's OK. If you dance, fine, if you don't, fine, I will just do my Evangeline character. But I need to know now!" She agrees to dance. I go out front of the curtain and chat with the audience about how the town hasn't changed much since I was there years ago. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am seated at a round table with other people and we are being guarded by alien beings (sort of reptilian). They are feeding us to fatten us up to eat us later. I realize this and pass my food on to the others so I won't get fat. I hope they don't notice. I watch them carefully, feeling fear because I know at some point I shall have to make a stand and will probably be killed. At one point I am somehow flying up the outside wall and peeking inside a window where two aliens are going to make love. As they do, I overhear one saying in horror, "You have a white cross mark on your hand." This means that their blood will kill him if he contacts it. I then know how I can save myself. Now I am back at the table and I try to set up a fight between aliens so their bad blood will kill themselves off. I hope I'm not killed in the process. [BL]]]></report>

One leg up and then the other and stretching every part of me. It felt wonderful. I tease Merle and tickle him on his round tummy. Now we are moving furniture, a yellow couch. Ginny helps. I pin some yellow sheets of paper up on a side wall of a stage area that is not accessible to wheelchairs. I walk, so it's no problem for me. Someone takes them down and I say, "Hey, put them back! I put them there so people can write on them. I am expecting lots of school kids to come." He says, "But it seems there are better places for this." I say, "I looked. This is the best place." Then I look around again and realize that the main gym wall is accessible and all I would have to do is move the kid's pictures displayed there up here on the side stage wall and use that space. I go to the man and say, "You were right. There is a better place." I go down to do that. I see a huge map of the world on the wall, and later I see it's gone. Now the kids are arriving. I see someone has taken something of mine and I complain, but what shall I do about the pain? I look and I see two Alka Seltzer pills and a small pill. I tell Ginny that these are mine, for the pain. Ginny is busting two kid girls for having drugs. She is lecturing them. [BL]]]></report>

I sit rather bored on a log or something. I lay back and notice the sky. On the left side, it is twilight and an occasional star. On the right side, is a black sky filled with stars. I wonder why that is and look back and forth at the differences. I then see on the right side that part of the difference is there are lots of cloud-like things which is the Milky Way. Now the men come back with the boys and are cutting up a big meat loaf into strips and squares to eat. I say to one of the men that I wish his wife Irene were here so I'd have someone to talk to. Then I look up in the sky again and see ducks, lots of them flying by, big adult ducks and lots of baby ducks. One duck attacks another and bites it. I realize they are very hungry. I want to feed the baby ones and get some bread and crumble it up. Some adult ducks land and eat and then a baby duck comes down and sticks to a wall. I go over to see it and notice it is a piece of cardboard folded in half and I open it to see a purple colored jewel and realize these ducks aren't born yet. This is their embryo in this jewel-like thing and they are still growing and forming. I regret having called them down and try to send them back on their way, hoping I haven't caused them any harm.

I ask someone to help me and I get out of my chair and get into the passenger side of the car. The other person then takes the wheels off the chair and folds it and puts it in the car with me. I thank them, shut the door and now transfer over to the driver's side of the car and open that door. I pull out a tool and reach for the parts of the chair to reassemble it. I was using the car as a transition to get to the driveway so I can continue on. I realize I am making a lot of work for myself. There must be an easier way. I start to sew the button on a sweater, which is putting the wheels back on the chair, sort of. One side of the sweater is pink and the other side is blue (like reversible). The button is big, white and thick. This is going to take lots of time and energy. [BL]]]></report>

"Oh, where is the 'B' tree? Here? No, here? No, ooh here it is, no, that's a bee, an insect, not a tree. Then here? Now here's an interesting tree! Look over there, it has a very interesting root structure, if we only could see it. We lay down on the ground and he picks up the bottom of the raised root structure (like mangrove trees) and I snicker and say, "Oh I must be wrong," but if it were the right tree, then it would be all raised and interesting. We are laying there next to each other, teasing. A man opens the door and stares down at us. Finally we get up and he glares and says, "Are you going to do this again?" We humbly say no, trying not to laugh. "Good," he says dourly and slams the door. We giggle and Justin says, "Where is a kissing tree?" I laugh and go to him and put my arms around him and kiss him saying, Here. I found one, a kissing tree." [BL]]]></report>

He puts his arm around him and says, "Is that what you want?" The robot doesn't respond but Ellie insists that is what he wants. Another bad guy robot says he can't hear them, so let him read about it. Ellie insists he can hear them. She says he's audio. (NLP) I grab him and lay him down, with my legs wrapped around him in a wrestler hold and I say things and watch his eye patterns. "Yes, he is audio," I confirm. The woman robot says she wants to be pregnant. The bad guy agrees. The second bad guy robot says, "How can you do this?" The bad guy says, "It's OK, it's just hypnotist stuff." They do it and then I have them back. The robot bad guy says, "Then I have a favor to ask of you. Will you put this package in MY car? (he owns it but because he's a robot the other guy uses it) and put a nice saying with it." I put my arm around his shoulder and hug him teasingly, "You mean something sentimental and nice?" I ask. "Like "1-2-3-4, beat it, beat it." It's a joke and I laugh. [BL]]]></report>

I see that someone has tried to fix the window problem. Howard comes in and wants us to talk. I groan, laughing a bit at myself and my resistance to this connection. He is gentle and coaxes me to sit beside him. I point out the broken window and say I hadn't noticed it, but obviously someone did. I was glad they did. [BL]]]></report>

Now I go to the window and see a store and people are going in and out and then I realize it is on fire. I see some smoke in the second story. I see people still trying to go in and think that is strange they would chance going shopping in a burning building, although the fire isn't seen yet as it is still small. Then the building suddenly is gone and I am shocked. It is supposed to be there but all I see is a new street intersection. I realize I am looking at a future picture. Later I am at a table with a woman and a woman bartender talking about dreams. We are impressed with their completeness and beauty. Later out the window I see the building again. [BL]]]></report>

There are two tiny potty chairs, already being used. I go stand up over a toilet no one is supposed to use and pull the shower curtain closed around it. I pee. Delores M comes in. We chat.

			<report><![CDATA[I give back the car keys to my boyfriend, who isn't treating me well. He's like Ted Danson on Cheers, a womanizer. I feel some regret because now I don't have a car and will have to figure out how to get around on my own. Now his other girlfriend needs to tell him goodbye and I am encouraging her to have the courage. She struggles and hesitates. I whisper, "Come on girl, come on. You can do it." Finally she does. She tells him it's over. Now I have to lead some group in a discussion of feelings. Two men have trouble. One is trying to share his feelings and another man is belligerent and noisy and interrupts him and they get into a verbal fight. Finally I say, "That's enough, you, leave." The man defies me and then finally leaves. Then they all leave. Now I am left with cleaning up and shutting the place up myself and I hadn't done that before. I don't know how to turn down the damper on the stove to get the fire to go out and be safe. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated and a bit of a failure for not managing to keep the group together.

			<report><![CDATA[I am lying on a couch, dead like. I look around the room and see it is still exactly like the moment the accident happened that killed me. A plant like my angel wing begonia lies in pieces on the floor where it was knocked over. A woman picks it up and brings the stem and leaves to me and says, "Look. Part of this is still alive. But it is without care and water for so long, but if you take care of it, it will live again." I am saddened and amazed that this could be revived. I sit up, now realizing I too am alive. My parents (sort of like Grandma Mildred and Grandpa Lloyd) are in the room and I get up and walk to them. They are shocked and happy to see I am alive. I go to Grandpa "dad" and he is seated in an easy chair, and I say to him, "Don't ever do this again. You left me for dead." He apologizes and his eyes are sad as he realizes what he did. I go back and sit on the couch and look out the window. High up on the hill is a new building, the new schoolhouse. My friends are there. I wave at them and my best friend sees me and they all run down to see me, so glad I am alive again. They swarm into the house. I am excited to see them. A man is there, a boyfriend of my friend, or my boyfriend. We all hug in reunion. I go out with them to get on the bus. [BL]]]></report>

I pick it up and cuddle it saying in a soft sweet voice, "Oh, there's the little kitty." Later, I have children, two half-grown boys and a six-year-old girl. I then am lighting the candles and am dressed in a 1950's housewife, pretty for my hubby, and he walks in the door with an unexpected dinner guest.  I am distressed, but handle it gently and with dignity. Later, I am cleaning up, he's now drunk and off to bed calling for me to come to bed and I am still cleaning up the sink from after the dinner.

			<report><![CDATA[I am at a conference, only it's in my living room. A woman comes from California and teaches. We'd had one last night and now I wake up on the couch and it's time for another one. The women come in and I sit up. The instructor is in the kitchen taking the dishes out of the dishwasher from last night as I hadn't gotten up and done them. I apologize to her, saying she doesn't have to do that. The dishes are white glass with gold trim on the edges. Bonnie had put them in because they'd been in my cupboard for so long and needed washing, from all the accumulated dust. A woman like Kathleen from poetry group sits on my right. I am telling them how the first time I used the word "abuse" to describe my upbringing felt so shocking, because it wasn't physical abuse, but emotional abuse. They were good people, but didn't know how to express themselves. Kathleen encourages me to keep calling it abuse and not cave in to society's ways of denial. I agree that I will persevere. I get up and say I need to pee and brush my teeth. There is a tiny alcove next to the living room, with a curtain as a door. I sit on a tall white bucket which sits on a toilet. I balance precariously. I pee a torrent of urine. It all rushes out of me at once. I know it can be heard by the women. Then the one man participant arrives. I immediately spill urine on the floor, it splatters from the rushing torrent. I am embarrassed. The topic f the conference is Men's Issues. I don't really want to be there, but I need the credits.

			<report><![CDATA[I have to pee really bad. I am in a house. Some man is injured and I am helping him. A cat is there somewhere, maybe also needing help. I go into a bathroom and try to sit on the toilet. It breaks off from the wall and is wobbly. I am standing and peeing so I won't tip it over. I pee voraciously all down my leg and around the room in front of me. I am concerned the water will back up and flow out of the toilet onto the floor. I leave. Now I am going from room to room in a hotel-like exhibit. I look out the window and see the beautiful emerald green ocean waves far below. There is a crowd of people walking through the exhibit as I am. I really need to pee and consider finding an exhibit toilet and using it. One room has a whirlpool and a single bed with an air mattress-like thing, sort of a health spa room. I wonder where people sleep and see another room with beds in it. I go out the door and go to the next exhibit room. On the way I see parrot beaded earrings and go over to see the price: 1 or 2 dollars, very cheap. I don't really want the parrots, but like crystal things or beaded things. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am at some campground where a conference is being held. Mary and Lucy are there. I go ahead to get us a seat at the luncheon tables, big round tables with pink tablecloths on them. I find one very close to where the speaker will be and secure a spot, saving a couple of spots for my friends. Other people are trying to sit at the table. Suddenly I realize that Deepak Chopra is sitting at the table. I see he looks ill. He has a snot booger hanging off his nose and looks bad. I say sympathetically, "You look ill." He smiles weakly. I try to help him. I offer to sort his speeches in chronological order for him. Later I go to his house with him as we'd struck up a relationship, but there aren't ramps and it is hard to get in and out. I gently chide him that he is not very sensitive to the disabled, even though he is one himself. Later I am W. talking with a couple of male friends about stuff and mention my co-worker John.

Then I am told it is being held in another spot and I go there to discover I'm a bit late and only get a spot in some other more distant section. It even requires another entrance at another field, called "Hunsaker "or something like that. I start to try and find the place to go and am told I have to take a shuttle bus thing there. As I am going to the bus stop, I tell some woman the story of how people resent people with disabilities and tell the Chopra story of the woman who said, "You have kind of an advantage, don't you?" I find a bus stop, but I'm not sure this is the right spot and I do not want to miss the bus. One comes from the wrong direction and stops and I run over to ask the driver if this is the right one or not. I nearly get hit by the bus as it pulls up to the stop. It is "articulated." He looks down at me and I can't seem to understand him, whether this is the one or not. I finally decide this is the one going to the station and go back to my spot to wait. The seminar seems so distant now. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am standing in a public bathroom in a health clinic place and combing my hair. I am very upset, because I scratched a sore scab and it is coming off with my hair attached (like my psoriasis of long ago) and I have bald spots. I am looking in the mirror at all the ugly black and blue bald spots and bloody lines where I've scratched them. Maybe my daughter Ellie, or someone like her, agrees to shampoo my hair and color it with dye. My hair is a dark black now. I don't know how I like that (color of June's hair). My blouse and bra are off and now two old men, gay men, get in the bathtub to do therapy together. I feel a bit uncomfortable, being so naked, but think, "Oh well, it's OK. This is a clinic." I turn and am now putting on my bra. One of the old men, now out of the tub says, "I hope she keeps the cleavage. It's great cleavage." I look into his eyes and he has on weird glasses like opera glasses inset into his eyes. I hurriedly try to get dressed. There is another room where patients are being treated, mental therapy. I am pacing. I am now a man. My friend comes in and asks where I am, even though I am pacing right past him. Other people (women) in the room laugh. I say, "Vagina," and a man laughs archly, "Aha." I am upset he misunderstood me and say, "No, not that meaning. I was trying to explain about a woman being pregnant." [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a living room, apparently mine and my new boyfriend and his 4-year-old son are with me. I am seated in an easy chair trying to clean up the area around me. It seems that lots of Charla's toys and junk from Ellie living there are piled up in the corner. The boy wants to play with his toys, but there is no room until I get the other stuff picked up. Now Ellie comes in and wordlessly starts picking up things. She pulls down the Christmas lights from the wall and other old decorations. It is way past Christmas. This is encouraging. I say I want to talk with her. The boyfriend realizes we need privacy and says he'll go to the other room for a while. Now Ellie and I sit side by side on another couch and I am very angry at her and I am slapping her face, only now Ellie is a tiny baby and I slap her face over and over. Now we decide to go upstairs to my bedroom for more privacy and Ellie leads the way upstairs. It is hard to walk up the stairs and the entry way is a cubby hole, not a door, which makes it physically hard to even get in. Then after we hunch down to crawl through, we have to step on a rickety ladder of sorts built up with like video or CD cassettes in a wooden rack which my boyfriend had built for me. That angers me too. Why did I choose such a difficult entryway to my own comfortable and nice room? [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Ellie comes over with Charla. She says she wants me to baby-sit her so she can go out to breakfast. She seems shy and hesitant. I think, "Well she might, after all we've been through." Ellie comes over to me, her face soft and child-like, and starts to hug me. Then she curls around me and wants to nurse, pulling my breast out of the bra. I am shocked. I say, "What are you doing?" She says something like a 4-year-old child might. She nurses. I know something is very wrong and don't know what to do. I remain calm. The sexual feeling of the nursing is beginning and I know she has regressed to some childhood place and I want to support her, but this is so odd. I can't do much other than tolerate the moment. I try to pat her and lay my arm around her, but I am not genuinely being her mother as a 4-year-old might want. I gently distract her from the nursing. It is clear now Ellie has a severe mental regression problem. Charla is clear and direct and her own energetic self. My mother calls me asking if I'd found the first aid papers yet. I say, "No, I have a real big crisis here and haven't had time to look." Ellie wraps her body around me. I say to her, "You are a 25-year-old woman, with a child. You need to act like one." Ellie doesn't seem to notice, she's so off in her own world. I know I have to have her committed. I'm not sure how to do that. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a house and there are lots of people there, a party. They are having a great time. I am on the phone talking to Archie I am trying to think of things to say to keep him talking to me. He is annoyed, in fact, angry at me. He says, angrily, "You are better than this, trying to manipulate it so we are alone. I don't like it when you do that. You know better than that." He hangs up on me. I feel terribly hurt and rejected, numbed by the pain of it. I turn and people are cheerfully calling out to me to join the party. I try to respond to them but it is very difficult. I go out to the back yard and something about Charla only having her diapers on. I see her and see she has an outfit of clothes on and looks fine. I comment that she is fine, perfectly and properly clothed. Her "mom" and "dad" want to stay at the party and I want to leave, to be alone. I tell them they can stay as long as they want. The "dad" says, "But she only has one diaper. We'll only be able to stay as long as it lasts." I shrug; not my problem. I try to leave. I feel weighted down with the sadness of Archie's rejection.

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a ward with physically and developmentally disabled people. They are wandering around crazy like. It is scary. I don't fit, so I go to the next room where the intelligent crazies are. They are men. I hang out with them. I am crazy too, I guess, or I wouldn't be there. I get a phone call from Derek. The line is static and hard to hear, and then the crazies are being noisy and I keep trying to understand what Derek is saying. He's trying to explain about his Chevy. Then he is angry at me and gets sarcastic, "Being in the head B. Just can't get in the heart, huh?" I say, "Stop it. Stop it." "Just tell me, B, I need you to be in the heart and I'll happily go there. I feel attacked and put down when you ride me about it." He is so distant with the static. I feel frantic trying to connect with him. [BL]]]></report>

A small orange and white striped kitten is with me, perched on my head. Mirabelle has a black and white one. I like the kitten. It is playful. A small mouse and the kitten are being used to demonstrate a point to me. The kitten eats the mouse and then lets it back out unharmed. I feel a bit uncomfortable and nervous for the mouse, but the mouse is OK. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Derek kisses me. I am disappointed because his mouth is hugely wide and it doesn't feel good. He French kisses and it is intense, our tongues intricately intertwining. I feel him have an orgasm and I am untouched with sexual passion. It feels very cold and self-serving. Now I am being chased by him and other people. I run for my life. They are gaining on me and then I am backed up to a huge barbed wire fence. I turn and fight hard, without guilt. It is simply necessary to defend myself. I box kick and do karate moves. I force the fence into a man's throat, so the barbed wire is poking his throat. I demand they open the gate. It slides open enough and I dart across "no man's land," a railroad yard, tracks and mud. A "living" box car is trying to run me over as I try to race across the land and over the tracks. It moves like a cartoon creature out to get me. I cross the other fence on the other side and run like hell. The landscape is dismal and frightening. I turn left and am in a hall-like place like the storage unit place. I duck into a storage unit where green plastic upholstered dining chairs from a 1950's style are stored. I sit in one and slide the door partially shut and tremble in terror. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am somewhere, supposedly at my place of work, only it isn't. I want to pee and try to in a bowl; it stinks and is exposed. A woman, perhaps Maren, follows me around. I am annoyed. I try to clean things up a bit, wash a dish, move a bottle to the sink. Then I go out into a large warehouse-like area and toward an open door. The woman moves ahead of me. I see the tip of a huge, black, shiny, pretty and dangerous tank. The woman steps out and is killed. I turn and walk back through the long huge warehouse building going toward the back exit. I am aware that maybe I should check and see if the woman really is dead, but that would be dangerous to me. Maybe I should warn other people, but I don't. I decide with a bit of guilt that I will call people and warn them after I get to my office, my place of work. I see cupboards and cabinets and think about hiding in one of them. I realize that is what I usually do in a dream, and decide not to do that this time. I find the back room, where two men are working, stacking wood furniture this company makes. I pass them without a word and go out the back door and around the corner. I look to the right and see the back end of the black tank which now looks like a large fuzzy black elephant, the same kind of fuzzy as my purse. I then run to the left and go up some steps to another building where my office is, only it's not my office and nobody is there and hasn't been there for a long time. [BL]]]></report>

Now I'm showering with Lucy, only instead of us doing it together, we take turns. I lather up with thick globs of shampoo soap. I am dressed, so when I lift up the blouse and rub my tummy, I get the dress wet. in spots. Then I eat something. Then Marshall comes in and talks about his client, who is a mess and does everything wrong and can't keep herself or her house clean. I realize with surprise he's talking about his wife.

			<report><![CDATA[Derek and I are going to make love. A young girl, maybe Charla, is there. I'm sending her off to her room. I need to go pee. I ask him, "My place or yours?" He says, "Your place." I go find a toilet and pee a lot. Then this bathroom connects to my bedroom. I go in just as he is opening the door to the bedroom from the hall. He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek. I curl up with the other man who says it's OK to press back against him if it's more comfortable. Derek gets out to rearrange himself and his assistant helps him back into the car. We are going to be together and that makes me happy. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Sparky wants to plug in a string of Christmas lights that have a short circuit in them, or rather the switch in the wall does. The lights go on and off. I suggest she try another switch or plug in. Kenneth comes in dressed in a graduation gown, a witch's hat and funky platform-heeled shoes. Sparky is a bit taken aback. I say, "He's like that," somewhat proudly. Kenneth grabs the string of lights and says, "Let's try plugging them in over here." I am pleased he has the same thoughts as I do and acts upon them. Now he's hungry and wants to eat. He grabs a hamburger from a buffet bar in the center of the room and another one for Sparky. She says she doesn't want it. So he puts it back and places two sandwiches there. A fat, bald baby is sitting there and she takes a huge bite out of the sandwich. I go to her to stop her from eating Kenneth's food. Her mouth is overflowing with mayo. She's sliding off the high chair. I have a bag in my left hand and am trying to keep her from falling off the chair and keep feeding her too. I wonder why I didn't think to put down the bag so I could use both hands. Then a man is laying on the floor. His face is pudgy and bald like the baby's. He says he's joined the Marines. I say, teasing, "They only want a few good men," and he and I say together, "but if you're not a good man, they'll make your life hell." We laugh. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Derek is painting pictures of mountains. I am trying to paint one too. I have my palette and see a sort of yellowish color up in the right hand corner, an odd color for the sky. Derek starts to dabble in my colors and I ask him not to. I then awkwardly attempt to paint. I draw a steep-peaked mountain and remember what my father said about how mountains aren't really that steep. I redraw it in softer curves. I discover how leaving some portions of the canvas blank and using that whiteness as a part of the picture enhances the picture. I create many different mountain ranges with some kind of building structure in the left corner foreground. It's pretty good. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I see a young teen boy (maybe 17 years old) on a raft in the ocean. He and his animal friends are on a mission, like Johnny Appleseed. There is a dog, a beaver, and other animals, including 87 baby tarantulas. When he began this journey, there had been only one adult. Even though he is a virgin and doesn't know how to make love himself, his job is to find the ducks and help them have sex so they will have baby ducks. I see many little baby ducks swimming around. He helps the female ducks sit on the male duck in the right position so the deed gets done. I know this because a male narrator voice is telling these facts as I see the picture. Now the scene changes and I am talking to a woman. She confesses she had another baby boy after Melvin. Although the woman would be Valerie, logically, it is Ginny. I now get to meet the long lost boy, who is an innocent young teen (as above). He has bright red hair. His name is Douglas. I say, "It's so nice to meet Melvin's half brother." He looks surprised and says, "Half"? I look over at Ginny. "Haven't you told him?" "Sorry." So they talk. I say to him, "I am called Auntie. I am like your Auntie." He formally says, "Hello, Auntie." I invite him to hug me. He does, but it's a bit stiff. Then he melts into a more natural hug. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I read a book that took me along time to get into, but after I kept at it a while, became interesting. It is a series of vignettes about towns, the last one being Mapleton. Now I decide to move to Mapleton. I am biking down the old highway and see a lovely stretch of grass and decide to bike across the "moors" for fun. It's very pretty and pastoral. Now I am in town and finish my errand and am biking back to my new home. My front wheel keeps getting caught in the old grooves of the asphalt and it pulls me a bit, so I struggle to keep on the road. I manage. I cross a bridge. I see I have a long way to go, maybe eight miles. I hope I get home before dark. I'll be tired, but oh well, it's a pretty ride and an adventure. I am munching on carrot sticks. As I approach a railroad crossing, the red lights come on. I know I'm supposed to stop, but I don't. I slow down and look and then scoot across anyway. At the last track to cross I look up and realize the train is almost upon me. I get across and then see the crossing guard bar. I think, "How silly of me to have forgotten they'd be down, how will I get by?" Then I see a way to sneak around the end. I am hearing the nuns chant as they go to seek answers or information from a young mystic girl. She was called a "pronuncio." She keeps repeating over and over, "You can not be plotted. You cannot be dated." [BL]]]></report>

He wants to go out and fist fight every one who is calling him squaw man. But a woman says, "Don't waste your energy. Ignore them." Now I am a woman and I walk up to a seated Indian man, who is wearing an 1890's kind of black jacket, like Wyatt Earp would have worn, white man's clothes. He's the foreman. He calls out the black woman I will have as a slave. He hands me the white, little plastic bag which has her documents in it. It's her "freedom" bag. I take it and hand it to her. I say, "Elizabeth. I give you your freedom." She doesn't understand. She thinks I'm firing her and she'll be alone and poor. I say to her, "You are your own woman now and I'd like to hire you. I will pay $6 a week." The Indian man shows me a picture. It has a bright spotlight in the center and a sidelight where he's standing. He says, "I'm in the side light because I'm an Indian. I've always wanted to be in the center spotlight." I say to him, "I understand. Believe it or not, I am in the sidelight too, because I'm a woman with a disability. We get the same kind of discrimination." [BL]]]></report>

I see Tyler telling Charlene one of his stories and smile because I know she has heard it many times. I wonder if she will just stoically listen or what. She finally interrupts him and says she has heard it before. She leaves and he smiles sheepishly. Now the man comes into my bedroom. I think I am rooming in his house. His son is upstairs. He is a quad and the man is crying as he tells me that today the assistant can't come today and he will have to be left alone. I offer to call in sick at work and stay to help him, but it would mean moving him downstairs and I couldn't transfer him. The man is grateful. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I, the dreamer, is watching a scene. I seem to identify with the married man. A woman and a man get married after a short, but loving, courtship. Soon after they are married, they begin to have misunderstandings and fights. They are always angry at each other and can't seem to reconcile it. They are miserable, yet they love each other. There is another man, an architect, who loves the woman and she goes to visit him. The jealous husband, who has another kind of career, follows her and comes into the house. The two men talk. The husband is angry and belligerent, but after a while the other man begins to understand that the husband is a good man, but hurt. So he helps the husband understand, and brings the woman and the husband back together, even though he still loves her. But now he is best friends with the husband and cares as much for him. The husband and the woman go out to the car to drive home when the woman's parents come to get in the back seat. They are argumentative and negative at the husband, who in his new-found understanding, doesn't tolerate it anymore. He tells them to shut up. The woman at first is upset and then understands that is right. She smiles at the husband. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A rather stupid, lanky man is asking me questions. I hold a package with a small plastic bag of white beads in it. It is a beading kit. He asks me what the words on the package says. I say, "Stretched string beads." He asks how many beads there are. Are there enough to bead a whole shirt? I answer gruffly, "How would I know? It doesn't say." I am annoyed with his attitude and questions. The man says, "Why don't you lighten up?" I realize I am being sharp and grumpy, but I say, "Because I don't want to," which is true. This IS the way I feel and I don't want to change it right now. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in the M City house, sleeping in my bedroom. I open my eyes and see my "dad" walking up to my open bedroom door. He is tall and lanky like Nate. He is so tall, his head is above the doorjamb. I feel fear. He is going to harass me. He then walks down the stairs to go to the bathroom. I sneak out of my room and run into my brother's room (actually the room my parents had). I crawl under the covers with one of my brothers trying to hurriedly pull up the covers over me. He's coming back up the stairs and I know a part of my shoulder may be visible. I know this won't work and I'll probably got my brothers in trouble too, but I stay there. He comes in and looks around. I think he sees me, but lets me be. He leaves. I go quickly back into my bedroom to the closet to try and change clothes before he comes back. As I pull a dress off a hanger, I am standing in the closet, which seems to have lots of room. A weird-looking girl comes and watches me. I tell her to go away. I pull on my dress, which I wonder if it is too fancy and will call attention to myself. I go downstairs to the kitchen where my mother is fixing French toast for breakfast. She wants me to do something and is grumpy. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I seem to be the prison warden. The men are surly and dangerous. I have to stop something and I use fast karate blows. I am damn good at it and beat my foe. Another powerful inmate is watching me closely, looking for his opportunity. I then go to the infirmary for the doctor to bind up my wounds, but he is also my fiance and he rejects me, I think because he doesn't want me doing this dangerous job. I am hurt, but bravely go on. I return, exhausted and emotionally drained, to my office and find a young woman and a Hispanic man trying to make out on the floor by my door. I tell her to be in my office at 3 o'clock and I'll teach her about birth control and then I decide the man better be there too. This was yet another betrayal and I am angry and self-righteous, and yet I'm trying to be doing the right thing for these people too. I enter, but it isn't my office; it is a courtroom. I interrogate the prisoner who is on trial, the man I beat up, and the other powerful man is secretly sending him signals by scraping the legs of his chair against the floor when he should not answer. I realize this is a code even though it is subtle. I am on the alert. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I and another woman are entering a big auditorium. We want to get good seats so we can see the events on the stage and meet in the back with our small group easily. It will be very crowded soon, we know, because we went through this before. I go to the left rear side and get a folding chair and then decide to go to the right rear side as that's where the small group will meet, but the athletic team has reserved most of the seats in the back and so I change my mind again and go to the left rear side to find all the places are almost taken and finally decide on the aisle. The ceremonies are starting and I lean way over to see. It is Rosalie, the Mayor of E City doing a discussion or speech and she's written "Rosalie" on the blackboard. It's just one word, her own name. I laugh and share this with a woman next to me. Then a male actor comes in and waits his moment. As he gets up to take a leather bag up the aisle shouting his lines, I realize the fingers of my left hand are caught in the straps and I am running up the aisle behind him, desperately trying to get my fingers out. I am wearing a bridal gown and veil. I finally get unstuck and go back and sit down. I tell the woman how embarrassed I am, how conspicuous I was. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a church community room and a group of church members are there. I have led them to believe that I am dying and they are having a ceremony for me. It is their tradition to gather in a semi-circle around the injured or dying person. Each member offers a gift and connects with the one who is dying in very touching, loving ways. The woman explaining uses the following example: "If a dying person wants to be treated like a queen, then someone might bring them a robe and drape it over them and bow and treat them like a queen." So, first the group stands in the front of the room and sings "Oh, Come all Ye Faithful." I stand in front of them, singing with them. I am deeply moved and near tears as I sing with them. The song is beautiful and I haven't sung for a long time, what with my throat difficulties. I am feeling very guilty for accepting all this outpouring of love on false pretenses, since I am not dying. Ellie is there sitting to my left. She looks at me, knowing I am cheating.

			<report><![CDATA[I have a questionnaire and I need three women and three men to answer it for me. I am on a bus and the door is open. A swarming crowd of revelers are all around. I watch as a man with a blue face lies on the sidewalk and tells the woman he's with that he loves her. I chuckle because it is obvious they are strangers and the man is horny. I try to ask several men to fill out the questionnaire. They are too rushed and busy. One hesitates and I kindly assure him he can go on, I can find someone else. Now the bus accidentally got caught in the Rose Parade. The marchers are a bit annoyed at us and we try to drive out of the way and park in a parking lot. We see a man who is very angry at a policeman for reprimanding him and he is angrily smashing the policeman's car to bits. Now I am in a huge house, perhaps a mansion. I am worried about Charla. A woman has lured her away and has taken her into one of the rooms and is molesting her. I see an image of Charla with her vagina exposed. I race from room to room opening doors and looking. I hear Charla calling off in the distance. Maybe she's on the third floor. I keep looking, worried. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am moving to an old house with odd rooms that spread out all over. Dwight/Howard is going to help me. Lucy and two babies are there. I am holding one and she is holding the other. We are trying to get them to nap as I walk around trying to think and organize how to manage this huge task. Finally, I get the baby to sleep. I open a door and it is a small bathroom. Really, only a bathtub is in it. I look at the kitchen, which has two or three wooden oak tables (dining room type) hanging way up on the wall for counter space. That will be awkward. Dwight/Howard comes in and I am frustrated trying to get his attention. He finally listens to my ideas but sighs and says, "It won't work. We made a mistake buying this rambling house and a mistake moving to M City. We belong back in the valley, so let's not take such care where things go and only unpack the essentials until we can move again." He then suggests we be friends again. I say, "No way." Now I kind of give up and sit on the couch with an older woman. I make a snide remark about how she can't work either because she's so old, and I can't work, cause I'm so old too. It's a sort of frustrated joke. Nothing seems to be going right. No one is helping. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am going down a street and see Archie, who is very sad. He is growing older and has a disability, a limp or something. He can't do his dance as he has before. I point out I know what that's like. I try and be sympathetic with him. I am interrupted by a woman who works for Lori and Dan T. She asks me to come to the office. I tell Archie to wait and I go into an office room. Lori is there, rather upset with me, and hands me a paper. I feel trapped and don't want to deal with this face to face, but now that I am here, let's get it over with. The paper is a bill for a phone call made by a Mr. Nelson for $48. She wants me to pay it. I hesitate and then get clear. "No," I say, "I will not pay this bill. It is not my bill. And furthermore I am very unhappy that you billed me for the carpet. I will not pay for that. In fact, I am expecting you to reimburse me my prorated rent and my security deposit." She becomes very upset and dramatically says to her woman assistant she cannot listen to any more of this. Her face is contorted in over-dramatic nerves. I am aware of Archie waiting for me across the street. I feel compelled to try and get to him, before he gets upset and leaves. I am caught in the middle again. [BL]]]></report>

I see a window. We end up in another room, only the water is following us. I look out another window and see a huge drop off. It's a well or tower area, but I look way up and see daylight. There's an open area up there. It's our only chance -- to go with the flow of water out the window and dog paddle in it until it rises up high enough to reach that light. It's like walking into death and riding it up to life. We do so and successfully make it, only to find that area of the castle is filled with men who intend to rape us. What irony! [BL]]]></report>

I and Andrea are trying to catch up with our group, but get lost and end up with a group of swimmers and divers. There is a swimming pool to the right, and in front of our bleachers is a pool used as the stage area. I watch a scene where a man and a woman get in a small rectangular rowboat and sing as we all sing the chorus. A wave or two comes up and splashes the woman and she mimes jumping up real quick so it doesn't get her all wet on her bottom. I and Aunt Bridget are sitting on the right side of the bleachers. It is very crowded. We sing along with the group but don't know the songs. I notice my voice is clear and pretty and I seem to be able to keep up with the words by listening carefully. I look over to the bleachers on my left and up and see a small group of people in green sort of fish costumes with green makeup on their faces. They are pretty and all the same. Now muffins and cookies and cakes are being served to the crowd and I can see they are moist and sweet and would taste really good, better than if we'd stayed with our own group. I look to my right and notice the water is all gone from the swim pool. There had been some girls taking lessons there. [BL]]]></report>

He is in the bathroom showering and I knock on the door. He calls out how. I do it. Then I go into another kitchen; more mess. I sigh. I must have not done a thing for a long time.

I have a long string of incompletes on my transcript. I am wishing now that I had chosen a 2-year master's program and just focused on that and done it. I'd have something by now if I'd done that. Some how this has to do with moving to a new city to turn over a new leaf, many years ago. The feeling is that in some other dream I had moved to a city to start school. Now in this dream I'm at the other end. So I try to do some homework and now I go to the school office to pay my tuition and fill out papers. The secretary is busy and I watch a mentally retarded girl lean over the counter, laying on it in my way, so I walk to the right and catch a secretary's attention. She asks for $56. I hand her a sealed envelope with my tuition in it. I thought it was to be $53. She opens it and pulls out a piece of paper where I had drawn pictures. I look at it and am surprised to see many different pictures of my cat in different poses and postures. I thought I'd only done one. I point out the empty spot where the mentally retarded girl had blocked my way. The secretary says, "That's a cold spot." I say yes, because that's the feeling I got from it. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am at some big college-like school. Some of the women students have stolen a recently dead man's corpse and are playing with it, doing some silly witch-like rituals over it for fun. I and a woman friend are shocked to see this (in the gym). After they are done, the audience is leaving and so are we. I say to my friend, "Come on, let's follow and see if we can retrieve the corpse and take it back where it belongs." My friend is in agreement and is surprised I cared enough to do this. We figured the element of surprise will be with us, because we are so quick to go to where I am sure they are going to leave it, namely in the sorority lunch room activity center area. I search and search, in drawers, opening doors, etc. and finally find a box which it might be in. I pick it up and sneak off to find the male professor that it goes to. I go down the halls hoping to remember his name. I find a college of his and ask to talk to him. I begin to wonder just who I can trust here. [BL]]]></report>

The woman who owns it says she'll sell it to me and I can move in right now and we'll do the papers later. I and my daughters start to move in. Each can have their own bedroom, the outside lawn is spacious and pretty, the rooms large and comfortable. I begin to be concerned because I haven't even asked how much for the house and if I will qualify for a bank loan for that amount. I am tired of living in my cramped little house, but it was the best I could afford. This will be much more. I see the short, almost midget-sized woman who owns it and go to her. I say, "I want to talk about the details before I get all moved in and then have to leave." She is busy driving a tractor towing a cart and I follow her, talking all the while. She smiles and wants to know what that other woman said about her. I say, "Nothing much." I didn't really listen. She says, "Good. Don't worry. We'll make a deal." She wants me to have the house.

			<report><![CDATA[Burt Lancaster and I are talking in a room. I am asking him about some of his movies. I ask him if a particular movie, "The Stone Commander," had a script or if they ad-libbed the thing. I think they ad-libbed. He says, "No, it had a script, in fact, it had two." I am surprised. Now I am counting rows of broccoli: 10 heads to a row and 10 rows. The woman who owns the broccoli asks what I'm doing. I say, "We need these for a movie about vegetables." She say, "Oh no, this is my favorite broccoli. It's so sweet." [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am preparing to do a performance at a meeting. The woman boss is talking and I realize I don't have my scripts with me for the play. I start looking around the office. I make a mess with all the papers I look through. As I am frantically searching, I also notice that the audience is off in another part of the room, partitioned off. If we moved ourselves into their room, we would be seen better. I check and see that there is plenty of room beyond the office partition. I wonder why we were told to do it in the office in the first place. I am worried that I can't remember the words or the sequence of things we are supposed to do. I am unhappy, and frantic.

			<report><![CDATA[We are having a serious meeting about the wording of some document. It's like the C. Department people but it isn't. I go to sleep in the middle of it, because it is so boring. They want me to agree with what they wrote, but I don't want to comment because I feel it doesn't say anything of substance. Now the meeting breaks up and a man is teasing me. We are joking and he is surprised I am fun to be around. I show them another meeting room I had prepared. They ask if there is enough room for 20 people. I say, "The room capacity is 135, I would think there would be enough room." Now I am looking at pictures in a magazine of a M City-like region with a old "Gabby Hayes" kind of man in the picture. Now I am harmonizing with some man a song that goes like this, "Whoa. The sun comes up in the morning." The harmonizing sounds very good. They are impressed. [BL]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am on a trip to Italy with a lot of my friends and their families. I am thoroughly frustrated because most of the girls on the trip are my age and most of the boys are juniors and seniors. All the girls are acting slutty and fake and all the boys are buying it. I like Albert and he keeps being stolen away by a group of slutty girls. Everyone is ignoring me. So that night (in my dream), I just cried myself to sleep. I remember there being about 100 twin size beds just lined up against the walls. There was one room for the adults and one room for the kids. Everyone was talking loudly and having fun and no one noticed me crying. I am woken in the middle of the night (in my dream) to find Albert sitting on the edge of my bed. I remember seeing his deep blue eyes and they shone in the moonlight. I also remember looking around and seeing all the 100 beds completely empty. So then Albert leaned down and just kissed me really innocently and sweetly. But then there was a knock on the door so he pulled away and looked really afraid. He said, "I'll come back later" and left. Then I woke up because my mother really was knocking on my door to wake me up.]]></report>

So all of a sudden it stops really quickly and I fall to my knees and am perfectly waist level with both of them. So for some odd reason I think that they want me to give them head and I am really embarrassed so I stand up very quickly. When we reach the dining hall, it's packed with the entire school and then some. So Nick, Aidan, and I get out of the elevator. I'm walking towards the front of the dining hall and Nick is following me, saying, "Hi Bea" and I want him to keep following me and I want to talk to him, but I keep getting pushed so I lose sight of him and then I wake up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that there was this war happening and that I was much more involved than I am in the war now In class we would have drills pertaining to the war. It was really scary. So all the freshmen and sophomores went on this trip and Sue and I were left behind. So when the trip returned everyone sought to create everyone's worst nightmare. All these people were chasing me and trying to shoot me, which I guess is my worst nightmare. I ran into my house, which was like the Order of the Phoenix in Harry Potter. Mr. Bailey was there with a palette of nail polish, trying to communicate some code to me. But I couldn't figure it out. So then I escaped to a kind of vineyard where Sue's worst fear was being realized. Her worst fear was that everyone had found out some secret about her. So there were all these freshmen and sophomores tormenting her in the trees of the vineyard, saying things like, "We know, Sue..." and then I remember one of them saying "We know about Abbylius," (I just made that name up in my dream) and then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was on this train. In each different car was a different song playing. And no matter how much I liked the song that was playing, I was forced into the next car. It was really hot in the train so I was wearing my bathing suit. The train stopped at my high school's dining hall. I went in and everyone was studying for exams. I sat down at a table with my friends in my bathing suit. Ashley came up behind Olivia and put a lobster in her hair and we all screamed. Then she came after me with another lobster, so I ran away. I finally got back to my table and grabbed my bags before heading back to my dorm. On the way I saw Matthew and David, but they ignored me. Frustrated, I parachuted (yes, parachuted) away. I was so scared of Olivia and angry that Matthew and David had ignored me. When I got to the dorm, I realized that it was the beginning of school, even though I had just seen everyone studying for final exams. I realized I didn't live here anymore, so then I rushed to my new dorm where I found Sue. She told me that she, Hannah, 3 other girls, and I all shared a room in Bundy. When I got inside, I saw Hannah rearranging the furniture in a way-too-small room for 6 girls. I remember being furious that Hannah and I had to share a room with 4 other girls on Bundy 1, where all of Ms. Prong's favorite varsity athletes lived. I thought there had to be some mistake. I went to the closet to put my stuff there and realized that I had left all my clothes somewhere else. I ran back to the dining hall to look for them. All the doors were locked and I remember looking in the windows and seeing everyone in there being gassed to death. I remember seeing my father and Albert slowly dying. For some reason this didn't bother me at all and I rushed back to my room to find all my roommates playing name games, even though we already all knew each other. My other roommates' names were Brianna, Susan, and Kaylee. I was so frustrated I didn't have clothes, so I borrowed some from Hannah. Then I did have to take exams and I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[So I dreamed that it was May again and everyone was playing Assassin as usual. Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $10 and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $10. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy. When I finally got there though, Mrs. Frank and her two sons were all waiting for me. Apparently they were a day early. Mrs. Frank told me not to listen to Seth no matter what he said, and I was so confused I woke up.]]></report>

We were cooking something and all of a sudden 100 male strippers jumped out and started stripping. It was really weird though because Alexis and I wanted to leave really badly so we started looking for the exit. The woman who directed the cooking show was mean and scary and wouldn't let us leave until we had shelved all the cans that were all over the ground. And then we had to organize them alphabetically. So we started. Then one of the guys came up to us and said he would let us out if we helped him make dinner. So we tried to help him make dinner, but we couldn't for some reason. Then the cooking studio turned into sand and flames, a beach bonfire in the middle of nowhere. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a dream that I was giving a tour of my high school. When I entered the chapel, it was pitch black and I could see nothing except for this little boy with a laptop. He jumped up to greet me and then launched into this discussion of wireless Internet on campus. He wanted to show me how it worked, so he turned some of the lights on really dim. I was shocked to see about 10 other people in the pews, all really old and like the boy with laptops. He went into all these programs and messed around on the computer until the lights shut off of their own accord, indicating that he was now connected to the Internet. I was surprised and impressed and had lost my tour. But it didn't bother me. I went downstairs to the mailroom to find everyone happy and excited, all carrying or eating candies and chocolates, all with roses and dressed in pink. They all said, "Happy Valentines Day" to me. I was surprised because I had no idea it was Valentines Day. It was really dark so I couldn't find my mailbox, yet I could see all my friends with their stuff. As I finally started opening my mailbox, Leah explained to me how much candy she had received and who had given her roses and such. I opened my box to find only 5 pieces of candy. Feeling rejected, I walked back upstairs where it was light again. I remember hearing this voice behind me calling my name, and I looked behind me to see Sam running toward me with one rose. He gave it to me and kissed my cheek before leaving. Puzzled, I went back to my dorm, where I fell asleep really quickly. I was woken late that night because the fire alarm rang. Hannah and I ran out of the room to a secret hallway I never new about before. We were all to wait there until a train picked us up to bring us to safety. So when the train finally came pirates who had stolen it controlled it. They kidnapped everyone but me. I had to run and hide in a nearby bathroom. When they came looking for me, I cut them with razors and sprayed their eyes with hairspray, and basically defeated them with beauty products (weird). Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was in a bookstore with my family. My brother and I found books about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, but they weren't the real Harry Potter books. We got them anyway. When we were checking out, my mother found a bag containing more bags of jellybeans. She was asking the main who they belonged to. I wanted the jellybeans and quickly told her they were mind and that I had bought them earlier. When we returned to school, I went to Sophia and Sue's room. Sue, Alison, Hannah, Aidan, and Jayden were all there and we started trying to take Sophia's bed apart to find something. Everyone was positive that it was an antique, Chinese-made bed, and therefore I would be able to take it apart and put it back together. I started to remove the different wooden panels, but never found out what we were looking for and couldn't put the bed back together. Finally Jayden and Aidan found a piece of wood shaped like an elephant that held the whole bed together like some sort of puzzle. So then I went back to my bedroom at home and fell asleep. But then Jackson, who had climbed up the tree near the window by my bed and was asking me to come outside with him. I was scared and moved to my desk. But my computer had been swapped with someone else's, and I couldn't use this one. Then, somehow, Jackson took my bed to his room. Horrified, I grabbed on and was flying to his room on my bed. When I got there he began taking my bed apart so that I couldn't leave; however, I got away anyway. When I got back home, my computer was right where it was supposed to be. I signed onto AIM and promptly started talking to Bill about his sister's relationship with his best friend, Sam. Then Jon signed on and asked me for my phone number to call me. I gave it to him and literally within the next 30 seconds, the phone rang in real life and I debated getting up to pick it up or not. But then I woke up and realized that it wouldn't be Jon calling since it had all been a dream.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I dreamed that I was walking through this swamp/bog thing. As I was walking, I came across a set of 5 bunk beds, all stacked up on one another. There were people having sex and they wanted me to join them. But I didn't want to, so I dredged on through the mud. Then I saw Jayden and Aaron fishing for frogs. With them was Aidan. He asked me to prom, but I didn't even know that the prom was so close, so I just kept walking. I finally had come to the end of the swamp and there were the dorms. For some reason Bellah was following me for accepted students day or something. So I tried to find my dorm room, but it was completely impossible. Instead of the hallway with rooms was a HUGE ballroom and lots of small dark corridors. And I couldn't find my room! Finally after walking around forever, I found my room. Outside it was a stack of books and a balloon with my name on it. Bella and I went in but there was yet another huge room. In this one was a cooking show. Fritz (my dog) was trying to guess what kind of sandwich they were making and he got tickled every time he got it wrong. I guessed PB&J, got tickled, and woke up laughing!]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a dream that I was on a long trip. We were all on this bus and we finally stopped at campus. I needed to find an alarm clock so I would wake up in the morning. I searched all the dorms to find a faculty member who would have one. Finally I went to Langton and the Mings gave me one I could borrow. They led me through the dorm, onto different hallways, and into different rooms. In each room there was no alarm clock. I became frustrated and then went down to Houk to find an alarm clock there; however, when I got near the School Archives at my high school, all the electricity went out. Everything just shut down. The only people from my trip I could find were Jayden and Aaron. We all walked past the Main Building. I think we were going to my house to see if the bus was there. Anyway, we eventually found the bus and started going to another private boarding school in a really small town similar to ours. When we got to the school, we all went to the locker rooms to shower. I accidentally went into the boys' showers and they all wanted me to join them. I guess I kind of wanted to, but I was scared so I went to the girls' showers. They were all wearing their soccer uniforms, so I just wore mine too while I showered. The next day we had to take exams. Sue kept trying to copy off mine. Then for our history exam we had to see Pirates of the Caribbean. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was in school and I had the absolute worst schedule. I had 8th period four days in a row and on Wednesdays and Saturdays I had all the periods. It was horrible. In Spanish, Sra. Perez made fun of me because I couldn't speak properly and I had to bathe Mr. Singer in history. When I went to English, I couldn't find my homework and I got into big trouble. I had 2 double chemistry labs a week and it was just turning out to be the worst school year ever. Finally, I went to math one day and it was the same class I had freshman year, except it was in an English classroom. The big projector was down and all the lights were off. Everyone was having sex and Anthony and Lou were there and they wanted me to have sex. But I was scared, so I went home for Thanksgiving break. I was at Sue's house and I went through this door outside. I was on a big mountain. Lord Voldemort had returned and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us. No one else knew it was him, and for some reason, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. On the mountain were Ron and Hermione, and Sue and I were throwing turkey to them to save everyone. But behind them were a lot of other bad people, so we were trying to get rid of them without hurting Ron and Hermione. Finally Ron and Hermione got up the mountain, and Lord Voldemort walked right by us. Sue understood and we both left because we were scared. We went to the lake because we had to try to take a boat back to my high school. So we started carrying out boats to the shore and ran into Mrs. Carter, who told us that my high school had moved to France. We ignored her and kept walking with our boats to the shore. We got into the water except we weren't in the boats. There were little kids in the boats and Isabel and I had to safely get them across the lake to my high school and away from Lord Voldemort. There was a fish that grabbed onto me and when I shook it off, it started to have babies. Then a snapping turtle chased us to land. Then I woke up.]]></report>

So we dueled, and Dumbledore was on my side telling me what to do because my wand was messed up. Finally it snapped in half and we all had to go to Diagon Alley to buy a new wand. On the train Kylie made fun of me for being blonde, even though I'm not. So I got mad and then she cursed me to death. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was sitting at one of the picnic benches at soccer camp and Aaron and I were discussing Anna Karenina and he had two of the characters mixed up or something and I was really frustrated with him because I knew I was right. I had the book and started to look it up. Just then my mother drove to pick me up and I left him. Then suddenly it was the first day of school. I was in the history wing and Ed was trying to show me something. He was pulling me somewhere and out of the middle of nowhere, Wyatt wanted to show me something different, so he began to pull me in the opposite direction. It was chaos because for some reason, it was also Parents Weekend. There were people everywhere. In the middle of everything, Gwenyth Paltrow was singing out of the blue. I was so exhausted; I finally went to my dorm. On the way, I met someone who gave me a pancake they wanted me to feed to the Maples' dog. I took a bite of the pancake and it was really good. When I was near the science building, the dog came out of nowhere and began to bite me. I was so angry and scared that I ran to my room in Houk. My room was completely deserted except for a queen-sized bed in the middle, the room with my Laura Ashley sheets on them. There was a secret passageway into my real room where Maria and Zoey were getting dressed. I realized that my clothes were too small, so I had to borrow some of Maria's hideous clothes. Andrea was there too. I finally went back to the main building only to realize that I had no schedule. I couldn't figure out what classes I had. I searched everywhere and went to my mailbox to find it. Jessica came to me and told me that the teachers were trying something different; on the first day of school everyone would just go to their classes whenever they wanted just to see if they liked them. I went to English and then to history. In history, Mr. Singer brought us down to the soccer field where there was a car race. He lay down in the middle of the field and began squirting mayonnaise all over the place. Then he started reciting a speech of Abraham Lincoln's. No one found this weird though. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was spending some vacation with Gianna. She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like "Antique M&Ms," where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a dream that I was running around the main building looking for Anthony. I finally went to the auditorium to find him. I saw someone who looked like him very much. It was his father. He told me that Anthony was nervous to be around me because he knew that I liked him and he liked me too. A few minutes later, Anthony appeared looking a bit surprised to see me. I asked him why we hadn't seen each other lately and he didn't answer me. He said he was going to get changed and we could go for a walk. We took a walk down to the English wing, trying to find comfortable chairs to sit in. We saw people in their English classes and for some reason this was weird because it was supposed to be summer or something. We got to the end of the English wing and saw that the chapel was dimly lit. We went inside and saw Faith playing the violin. She left immediately as soon as Anthony and I got there. But she left her metronome on. I went to turn it off. Built into the metronome was some sort of sprinkler; when I went to turn it off, I got soaked. I told Anthony I was going into the little chapel loft to get undressed/changed. I crawled up there and went to a pew in the back and began to peel off my soggy clothes. Then I saw Anthony's face near the staircase and he came up and helped me get out of my wet clothes. Then he kissed me and I woke up. Then I dreamed that I was playing soccer and James Franco was the referee. He kept talking to me and teasing me until the game was over. Then I woke up again.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I first had a dream that Valerie and I were in this great big house with Brody. We were playing some sort of board game. I think maybe somewhere on the game there were sexual references or something, because very soon he was assaulting us. Valerie and I ran as fast as we could through the house, but he kept following us. Finally, I took off my belt and tried to whack him with it. Nothing happened. Valerie and I ran out of the house and into Mrs. Carter, who drove us to another house. Aidan and Jason were there and they saved Valerie and me. Then I had a new dream that there was a wedding at Sue's house. Everyone was dressed like Drew Barrymore in Ever After. All the kids, though, were playing games in the living room. I went in, and Sue, My brother, Ian, Claire, and Wyatt were there. We all started chatting and coloring until Mr. Bailey came in and announced that we all had to exercise, or something. He made Wyatt do 100 push-ups. I sneaked out to put my dress on, but it had gone. Then I woke up.]]></report>

I walked out to Langton because it was closest and tried my luck there. The key opened the door and I was thrilled, until I saw about 100 boys draped all over the furniture. They told me that I didn't live there I was so scared I went back to the main building. I tried to figure out my schedule, which I didn't have, as usual. I can't really recall all the details, but I remember waking up and thinking that it was an "outrageous dream about school."]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My first dream was that I was playing an ice hockey game and all my senior friends had come back to watch, like Aidan, Nick, Anthony, and others. I also remember other faces like Aaron. My stick kept switching from a lefty to a righty, and it was horribly frustrating. We won the game and after I got undressed and changed, I went to the stands to say hi to everyone. I started crying because I had missed them all so much. Then, all of a sudden, everyone disappeared except for Aidan. We sort of started walking towards each other, and then he started crying! And then he disappeared too! I was so sad. That night I went home and had to give this show about a horse. It was 1am and I was showing this horse. Then I saw Aidan crying. I ran to him in the room at soccer camp where we watch movies. He kept saying, "You don't understand," and then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a dream that I was babysitting my brother and we were watching movies. We were watching the Star Wars trilogy. When it was over, he wanted to watch Pocahontas. We were in something I remember as a "public living room." Other people walked in and this one girl had a huge crush on my brother. When I was done babysitting him, I had to go babysit the Pike children in Post. When I was there, it started to snow. Mr. Pike got home as I was unloading the dishwasher. He paid me and let me go. Then school started. I had to go to a Spanish class that was somewhere else. I was packing my backpack to go, and all these people kept taking my stuff and pestering me, so it was impossible to pack. I must have woken up and then begun a new dream. I was one of the friends of the Culkin family. Also in this group was Aidan. We all got really drunk and started walking on this bridge, complaining how adults never understand kids. We were all planning for a surprise party or something...Aidan was meant to guard the door while we all set up. But then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was attending soccer camp again. Hannah and Sue were there. We were all having so much fun and looking forward to the next weekend when we'd go to Hannah's house. It was then Friday and we were done with camp. We were all walking towards Hannah's car, when all the younger campers practically killed us by kicking their soccer balls at us. We loaded our bags into the car and went to Hannah's house. I remember us all showering when we got there. Then I wandered around the house into a beautiful Renaissance style living room where two people were having sex. It was really weird, so I left and then woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that my father was having dinner with Matthew, Albert, and Anthony. They were going to a sleepover later. I wanted to shower before they arrived. Halfway through my shower, I thought I heard them, so I got out and went downstairs. For some reason, Camilia had come and wanted to shower too, so I let her shower while I watched TV. When she was done, I remembered that I hadn't conditioned my hair or anything, so I went back in. When I got out of the shower for the 2nd time, all the boys were there. They began rolling out sleeping bags and mattresses, preparing for the sleepover. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. This dream I can't remember exactly, except that Hannah, Sue, and I were mad at this other girl.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was at soccer camp again. Charles was one of my counselors and he kept teasing me, in a good way, I guess. Every time I tried to take a picture of him, he would duck or run away. I finally took one of him as we were walking indoors to eat lunch and watch the movie. Inside they were serving lunch (pizza and brownies) to us. Everyone kept saying, "It's OK, we have 2 hours before we have to run again. So I ate some. Then it got dark, as the movie was about to start. I started to fall asleep. When I woke up, everyone was unplugging the lamps. It was really weird, because it was already dark. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that it was the end of the year and all the seniors were about to graduate. Sue and I were preparing for our exams. It was the night before graduating; so all the seniors were playing games while all the underclassmen were studying. I remember looking into a room and seeing Nick and another girl, which made me jealous. I forget what Nick said, but I left, furious. Sue and I didn't have the proper materials to study for the chemistry exam. We snuck into the science building to get the stuff. When we got there, there was some sort of leak or something, because the whole building was flooded and smelled awful. Sue and I grabbed buckets to carry everything. We swam through the hallways trying to find a light switch. We couldn't, so we returned to the main building. All the seniors were getting ready to leave, and I was so sad and flustered because I didn't think I would see any of them again. Then I saw Anthony and he hugged me and kissed me goodbye. Then I must have woken up and started another dream about The Da Vinci Code. I remember the albino monk, Silas, was trying to kill someone else, and I was trying to stop him. The man Silas was trying to kill came to me for help. He wanted me to disguise him. So I cut him a pair of jeans. I guess I thought that would disguise him. I kept waking up in the middle of the night though.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that it was the beginning of school. Even though I was supposed to be rooming with Hannah, I had to spend the first night of study hall with my old roommates, Zoey and Maria. I was really annoyed, but I knew that if I spent just one study hall with them, I never would have to again. I think it was probably nearing the end of study hall, because I was feeling really impatient to leave. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. In this dream, I was at this summer camp. Sue was there and we were having a lot of fun. On the last day, we had to board buses to get us home. One kid was frantically telling us that when we got on the bus, they were going to give us an oxygen mask because of the altitude. Only it was a gas mask and if we put it on, we would die. Sue and I got on and held our masks to our faces, pretending we had them on. We saw a lot of kids put them on and then "fall asleep." We closed our eyes to pretend. The bus stopped and everyone who was alive got out, while they cleaned all the dead bodies off. Sue and I stood outside the bus, crying. When we got back on, they were going to gas the whole bus. I just remember thinking, "This is it, no one will know I'm dead for a long time. I can never see my family or friends again." But just as we were about to board the bus again, a volcano erupted, causing everyone to scatter. I ran all the way home and then woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[First I dreamed that my friends and I were all trying to help Matthew get into Yale. We were helping him with classes and applications. I think he ended up getting in, but then I started a new dream that was really weird. I had three bedrooms, and whenever I had to talk to someone, they always met me in the wrong room. My next dream was about taking exams. I dreamed that right before each exam in the morning, we all gathered in the dining hall and individually ordered French toast and bacon. The woman got angry because she didn't want to cook. I was slightly confused. My last dream was about this game. There were 20 people and 1 killer. Everyone is trying to find out who this one killer was before they died. They were all forming pacts and groups, just to be betrayed. It was really odd. Then I woke up.]]></report>

All the seniors were talking about how much fun it was, and all the freshmen were looking really scared, but I wasn't. Then I started a new dream. I was in Bundy and Lou was in Owen. I really wanted to see him, but I needed an excuse to run over there. I saw someone delivering a pizza, so I decided I would sneak in when the pizza delivery guy went in. I scooted inside and went to my friend's room (can't remember who...) then I went looking for Lou. But it was Anthony I found. He kissed me and then I woke up.]]></report>

When we were done, we left to go home. I lived somewhere else. We saw tollbooths and drove through them, but immediately after we entered, all the cars changed directions and they were heading towards us! Horrified, I turned the car around. Then for some reason, we were looking for Anthony to surprise him. He was living in Texas, and when we got down there, people were throwing sand at his house; however, this was considered a gesture or admiration or something like that. Then I started a new dream where Ed was having lunch. Weird. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that my family and I went to McDonalds every meal. All my friends did too. It was like school, or something, everyone went there everyday with his or her families. The McDonalds was owned by a really sweet man, so when he one day raised the prices, I didn't mind. Soon everything was really expensive, and we stopped going there. My next dream was that someone was trying to kill me. I wasn't being chased or anything like that, but someone was trying to kill me. When I was asleep (in my dream), Lou came into my room. He started crying, and when I woke up he told me that he was the one who was trying to kill me. Then I was at the Lincoln Memorial and it was burning down. Then I woke up in real life.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I first dreamed that Sue, Lou, Tristan, and I were all in math class with Mr. Stipps again. We were all trying to find out this one problem, but it was nearly impossible. It was so frustrating. I guess Isabel and I finally gave up, or we figured it out or something, because we eventually left. We went to check our mail. I tried to open my mailbox, but it wouldn't open. I kept trying to open it, but it would just not open. Then Sue and I saw Mel Gibson coming to check his mail (at my high school for some reason...) and he laughed at us because we couldn't open mine. I then started a new dream where my family and I were driving somewhere. We were just driving along the hallway when, all of a sudden, I noticed no one was in the driver's seat. I felt really worried and tried to steer from the back seat. It was really difficult, and I ended up skidding off the road. My last dream was the best! It started badly though. I came home to find all the kids from the local high school having a party. Kylie was throwing the party, and I was really angry. Apparently my house was attached to one of the dorms by a long hallway. So everyone kept running back forth stealing stuff from the dorm rooms. Kylie found this tiny object that was like a kaleidoscope in the shape of a rock. It was brightly colored and she let me look at it. I looked through it and was surprised to see pictures of Anthony, waving, smiling, playing, laughing, reading, etc. I realized that this was the graduation present his parents had given him that he had been waiting to open. I was furious with Kylie for stealing it. I called Anthony and we started chatting and laughing. I kept walking through the hallway to Post, where Anthony lived, but Kylie kept running after me. She wanted the kaleidoscope because she thought Anthony was cute and wanted an excuse to talk to him. I got really mad and tried talking to Anthony through post-it notes. It was really weird. I kept talking to him and then he invited me to his room. He was teasing me crawled on top of me when I sat on his bed. He saw that I had his kaleidoscope and was so happy that he kissed me! Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that Charla and I were walking through the athletic center and we passed the boys' locker room. The doors were wide open and we could see all the boys inside. We went inside and started talking to them. For some reason, going into the boys' locker room was against the law, and Charla and I knew this, but we kept talking to all the boys (in their towels, by the way). Suddenly, Mrs. Carter pulled us away and began lecturing us about how wrong it was to go into the boys' locker room. I soon fell asleep and had a dream within a dream. This dream was about shopping. I was in Costco shopping for food to keep into my dorm room at school, but then I got lost. I woke up and Mrs. Carter was still lecturing me. Then I really woke up in real life.]]></report>

I kept getting the email returned to me. Frustrated, I went back to Bundy to see Hannah. It was snowing and all the heaters had broken up, so Katie and I huddled under our comforters, reading. We talked for a while before going to the main building to get dinner. On the way, I saw Matthew. I really wanted to talk to him, but was too shy. Hannah told me to just go up to him and say "hi," so I did and he picked me up and twirled me around. He laughed, put me down, and started walking away. Hannah yelled across the hallway, "See, Bea! It's so easy to talk to guys! I told you!" I was embarrassed, but luckily Matthew didn't her. Julian, however, did. He began to laugh, but he didn't care. We went to the dining hall and saw Caroline and Sue. They were getting rice and singing the Goo Goo Dolls. Then I woke up.]]></report>

I got to pick out a stuffed animal from a bag. Jon was there and had given me a Tiffany heart charm bracelet with my name engraved on it. Aidan had bought me dinner. The best part, though, was Anthony pushing through the crowd and taking me on a date to a swimming pool. We swam around all night and it was really warm. HE would lift me and carry me on his shoulders around in the water, all the while rubbing his hands across my skin. Then I started a new dream that my brother and I were in the library and we were standing in front of the Mona Lisa. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I first dreamed that I was in Florence, because that is where my parents were getting married (weird). Either I was really sick or sad, because someone gave me a huge cake. I remember falling asleep in my dream and being awoken to crashing noises and explosions. I looked out my window, and people were running and screaming everywhere. It was weird though; they were all celebrating for something, rather than screaming about something bad. I was frustrated because I couldn't find anyone I knew and I had no idea what everyone was screaming about. Then I must have begun a new dream because all of a sudden I was at the spring carnival. Everyone was having a lot of fun as usual --Jello-wrestling, slip-and-sliding, and everything else --I can't remember a lot of details, but then everyone went to the dining hall. I was eating strawberries with sugar. Across the dining hall, Leah was strutting around on a table. She got embarrassed and tried to make it a joke, but no one laughed. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was at the beach and was swimming against Rachel. I had to swim from one dock to another, so I dove in and touched the bottom. Immediately, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I struggled to the surface, feeling the pressure on my lungs. It was really scary and I kept pushing upward. Finally I reached the surface and gulped air in. I was breathing really hard in real life and woke myself up for a second. Then when I fell back asleep I was walking home from the beach in my comforter. I was so tired I could barely stand up. It started raining and this little boy appeared carrying an umbrella and he kept me dry. When I got to my house, I asked him his name. It was Colin. So I got home and Kylie called asking me to help her on her math placement exam. I really didn't want to, but she kept begging me, so I couldn't just hang up. So then Sue drove up and asked me if I wanted to go with her to the mall and then to the movies. I really wanted to go with her, but Kulie wouldn't stop bugging me, so Sue drove off. I was really mad. Then the power went out and I couldn't turn my computer on.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I had a very odd dream that there was this huge concert on the quad. There was a stage, a crowd, and everything. It was right in the beginning of the year, so everyone was really excited and energetic. I was sitting next to Gianna and we got called up on stage. When we got there, it started to shake uncontrollably, like some kind of trampoline. Everyone was laughing and cheering as we struggled to stay upright. We finally got off and walked inside Langton so I could go to the bathroom. I saw Lou and Ariana washing dishes. They had just seen my "performance" and were being really critical of it. Ariana said that when she saw me, she wanted to vomit. Lou laughed and then --to my horror --agreed. He was going out with Vanessa, and Ariana was discussing that now with Lou. I ran to the other end of the dorm and began to cry. I hated him for agreeing with Ariana, and I hated myself for liking him. On the opposite end of the hall was a movie theater. I went inside to watch Finding Nemo. There was a guy with flowers waiting for me; he was oddly reminiscent of Anthony. We began to chat and laugh, and soon Lou was out of my mind. When the movie was over, we walked out of Langton to find the campus deserted. We entered another dorm to find lots of people crammed inside. All the students were doing ridiculous chores and exercises as punishment from the teachers for having the huge concert. We ran out and into another dorm to avoid being caught and made to mow the grass with our teeth, or duel each other with umbrellas. We ran upstairs to my room. We could hear a teacher frantically pursuing us. I had the topmost loft as my room, only accessible by a leader, which unfortunately had been shattered. We tried in vain to climb up, but it was useless. We were caught and led downstairs where we were forced to drive metal pegs into the ground. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was on some trip somewhere and I was driving a huge coach bus with all my friends in it. Since I was driving, I was the one who decided where we stop for bathroom breaks and stuff. No one could agree with me about when and where to stop though, so I became frustrated and finally stopped at a rest area. I saw a little boy who looked lost. He spoke Spanish, so I said, "Donde es el coche?" (Where is your car?) But then I remembered that I had to use estar instead of ser. So I corrected myself and said "Donde esta; el coche?" A man nearby told me that the only way the little boy would find his way home is if I brought him to the church at the end of the mall at the rest area. I asked, "Donde esta la iglesia?" A woman told me she would lead me there. So I picked the little boy up and walked behind the woman. On the way I saw Ava; she had been shopping. She showed me a black tank top she had bought from Express. She asked if I wanted to borrow any of her money to shop, but I said no. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had this horrible dream that we were playing a hockey game. Our third line (my line) was completely out of it, and we just couldn't play. One girl was missing from the first line, so Chloe moved me up to play with them --big mistake! They were much faster and more skilled than I. I would try to pass the puck, and they'd be gone from the space I'd passed to. I couldn't position myself correctly because they would always skate away. Finally the game ended; we had won, and Chloe and Mrs. Carter were thrilled. Everyone then left and I was alone on the bench. Then all the lights went out. I began to take off my equipment right then and there. Doing so, I managed to lose my gloves, pants, and skates. When I finally had put what was remaining of my equipment into my bag, I assumed that my skates had somehow magically been transported to the locker room. I must have started a new dream, because next thing I know I am talking to Anthony. And it's weird because I know somewhere in the back of my mind that he's dead. But I kept talking to him. I was so sad because he was dead. But then I woke up.]]></report>

The CIA would tell us general areas where someone had been murdered, and we would have to go scout around for either the murderer or the dead body. It was really scary because the killer could be anywhere, and Sue and I were the only ones who could see the body. We had special equipment and everything. It was traumatizing to see the bodies. I remember seeing the lower half of a body with knives stuck in the legs. It was horrible. Thank God I woke up!]]></report>

My mother stood up and told everyone to be quiet and listen to my most embarrassing moment --how ironic, as that would easily be my most embarrassing moment. I was horrified and stormed out of the auditorium. I want to check my mailbox and the new Facebook was there. I went upstairs and there was a database there that recorded all the hookups in the entire school. Then I woke up.]]></report>

From 7:30-8:00 I could work and study, but then at 8, I had to strip down to my underwear and go into a cell where it was wet and freezing cold. I was abused and hurt or an hour and a half and I was furious because I didn't even know why. I hated it! Then I had a dream that my family and I were all going on a trip to Sea World. My brother and I sat in the splash section, and then left hurriedly. On the way home, we were playing in the sand, trying to set up some sort of box. We got sand in our eyes and rushed to wash it out with the ocean water. Our eyes really burned then from the salt and the sand. Then Hannah and I were walking back from lunch or something to Bundy. The seniors were all trying to yank each other's pants off to embarrass one another. When Hannah and I got to the dorm, we had emails from all of them saying something bad was going to happen. Anyway, then I had a dream about Counting Crows, that I was going to see them. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[So first I dreamed that I was at my high school and it was the last day of this year. All these guys were asking me out. Then I was at college in California. It was the kind of college where if you went to my high school, you immediately went to this college. Then there were other kids from other schools there as well. It was really dangerous. We had to cross 6 roads all next to each other to get to the school. The last 2 were these horribly steep and narrow staircases where people would skateboard. I was walking down them and the skateboarders couldn't see us. So I was especially scared. I finally got to my dorm and all my friends were going skating. They all left and I changed and put sunscreen on. Andrea and Camilia were there and they wanted to know if my boyfriends at my high school had made me any more comfortable with dating in college. I guess I kind of blew them off, because next thing I know, I am at the beach. It started to rain, so I had to go back to school. I was so sad when I looked at all these pictures of my high school friends and realized how much I missed them. I was in English with a lot of the freshmen, and Ms. Williams came in and announced we were having the school play that day. Everyone was really excited, except me, because it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were my best days, so I would have to miss my favorite classes. We had 30 minutes before we had to be in the auditorium. I went looking for my friends. Sue was giving a tour. Gianna and her brother were up in the math wing. I started walking to the dining hall. Gabby was in the senior quad and she started making fun of me because I always looked shy. Beside her was a shelf of books. They were all fictional love stories. Then I woke up.]]></report>

All of a sudden, we were back in the dorm. Sue was showering and Hannah and I were in our room eating Cape Cod chips. When Sue came in, the fire alarm went off. We all had to get out of the building. The sprinklers went off. So then I had a new dream that I was at Audrey's house and Pauline was getting married. Audrey wanted me to ride Pauline's horse into the woods to find the rest of our relatives. When I got on the horse, he started talking to me. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a horrible dream last night! First, Lord Voldemort was after me and I couldn't hide from him. I tried to run outside my house in the woods. He heard me and went back inside to get a flashlight for some reason. Then I ran up by the Links' house and Mr. Links came back with his flashlight. He found me, so I made a deal with him that if he stopped killing everyone else, he could kill me. It was so scary. Then I had a dream that we bought a new dog crate, not even a new dog, but just a new crate. It was a huge deal for some reason. I couldn't understand why everyone was so worked up, but whatever. So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused. I asked him what his problem was, and he said something to the effect of, "At least I didn't sleep with someone to get a good grade. I don't want you sleeping with other boys." I guess it was cute that he cared, but it was horrible having him mad at me!]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My first dream was that it was exam time and I had taken every exam except for Spanish. For Spanish, I had to clone people. Jackson was right in front of me doing the same thing. The clones came from every room, and it was impossible to keep track of them. Finally, Sra. Perez said we had made enough and that we could leave. I had had a lot of feelings towards Jackson lately. He brought me into Tinker into an empty room. We weren't doing anything except kissing, but the whole time in there felt really sexual. He had his shirt off or something, but it felt like we were doing more than just kissing, even though we weren't Anyway, we were there for awhile before the person who lived there came back and kicked us out. We were holding hands as we left. We went to the library to start studying for another exam, which was weird since we were done with our exams. Then we had Fun Friday. It was the weirdest one ever, but it was everyone's favorite. There was a monster onstage plus 3 students. The monster could see one person, but not the other two. We all had to kill the monster, but the more people that came on stage, the more the monster could see us. He could also hear us. I remember looking at my watch and realizing an hour had gone by. Then I woke up.]]></report>

When I picked up, however, I realized that I had bought a righty instead of a lefty. I was so disappointed at myself for my foolish mistake. No matter how hard I tried, the stick stayed righty. All the other girls laughed at me. Then I started a new dream that was at my brother's 2nd grade parent-teacher conferences. I was really bored and kept falling asleep until the teacher used me as an example of the student who had perfectly gotten through elementary and middle school, and that I was doing excellent now as well. Then another woman engaged me in a conversation about Pirates of the Caribbean but I fell asleep (in my dream). Then I woke up in real life.]]></report>

Next day I was watching the real Olympics. I realized I had hockey practice, so I ran to Bundy to get ready. I was really panicked because I couldn't find my watch or something. When I got there, someone had died. We had this huge underclassmen funeral. Then I was in a department store of some sort. Someone else was with me and there were these two sort of scary-looking men, who wanted to buy us jewelry. We found two pairs of earrings we liked, and they went to buy them for us. The woman at the counter said they were Tiffany earrings, but somehow I couldn't believe her. There were 3 little dogs there too and they were yapping all over the place. So then I was at Hogwarts. Professor Snape was looking all over the place for me. I accidentally set off a charm that made all these bombs explode. The whole school rushed into the hallways. We had to bring as much money outside as possible. It was freezing outside. But then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that my brother and I were electricians of some sort and had to install TVs into houses/trailers in a trailer park. It was scary because the trailer park was next to a chemical plant, so it was always releasing chemicals and other horrible things into the air. And it was really loud. The trailer we were working on was constructed like an airplane. My brother and I tried to figure out how to fly it, but couldn't. So then I dreamed it was exam period. I had an 8am math exam, but for some reason instead of going to the classroom, I went to the movie theater to see Love Actually. This didn't seem at all weird though. Caroline went in and told me she'd save me a seat while I went to get ice cream. I wanted Butterscotch ice cream, and there was only one vendor that had it. My mother was in the line ahead of me. As soon as it was my turn, the woman closed everything up. I was really annoyed and went upstairs. All these junior and senior boys I didn't know were there. I really wanted this butterscotch ice cream, but no one had it. Instead I just had some diet coke. Everyone was leaving the movie theater, so I guess I missed the movie. I found my friends and realized that my dress had fallen off. I left hurriedly, thinking it was just a trick of my mind, hoping it was just a trick of my mind. I saw Lou walking out of the dining all. He was carrying something and his hair was really short. I noticed he was wearing these terrible looking shoes, and I decided that I should stop liking him for that reason. I went back to my friends and all of a sudden I was looking into a deep abyss, like where Mordor is in Lord of the Rings. I ran away as fast as I could and ran into my math teacher, who noticed I had missed the exam! Thank god I woke up!]]></report>

I missed the boat and had to swim over. I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I couldn't understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended 3 hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next 3 hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK. Then Jackson looked at me and said he loved me and I woke up.]]></report>

Then I dreamed that Charla and I were in New Hampshire at Granddaddy's, and she wanted to take a boat on the lake at night. I knew it was a bad idea, but I went out with her anyway.

Then I dreamed that Sue and I were doing track. We finished with our warm up and this guy came up to talk to me. He was cute, sort of looked like Dylan and Nicholas put together. We were talking and flirting, and then all of a sudden, we were back at my house. He was flirting with me while we watched a movie.

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed first that I was in this huge mansion and I had to help deliver all these babies. All the women having the babies had to go up all these stairs though. Then I had to help them down the stairs to the delivery room. So then I was a slave in some huge landowner's house and I was running away with a baby in my little green Oshkosh overalls from when I was a baby. So we stole this food and other things we would need and put them in Bloomingdales bags. As soon as we left the house, the woman came after as, so we hid under a bench. I prayed she wouldn't see us or hear us breathing. The next dream I had --I was in the library trying to steal something heavily guarded by giant squids. It was impossible and I was really frustrated. The library was like a planetarium, so I lay down and looked up at all the stars in the ceiling. Then I had to go to Spanish class. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I first dreamed that I was in the chapel, which was huge. Lou was next to me and I remember hearing the organ music from above. All of a sudden, I was in my bedroom. My friends and I were flying mattresses outside my window. There was tundra and icy cold water beneath us, so we didn't want to fall in. First it was just Sue and I, so it was easy to balance. Then more of our friends wanted to join us, but we weren't sure if the mattress could hold all of us. So Sue took a rope and attached it to the mattress and swam through the air. We were all fine. Then I realized that we didn't have our wings, and we all started falling. We landed hard in some military school. We ran away. So then I was at school in the snack bar. I ordered a blueberry muffin and ate it outside. I saw Caleb reading something and he called me over to lie down with him. I lay down and he put his book down. He wrapped his arm around me and held my hand with his free hand underneath his chin. He blinked and I could feel his eyelashes on my forehead. Our lips were touching, but we weren't kissing. I was worried about my breath. He started breathing a little harder and pulled me closer. Then I saw my mother and father, but they didn't see me. And then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that we were having Martin Luther King Jr. Day in a huge stadium, like Madison Square Garden. One of our all school sessions had just finished, so we were all leaving. I saw Jackson and we did our little smiling thing. I made the sign that I would call him. So then I was doing laundry in the mailroom and I ran out of quarters. I finally found some and put them in the slot. I remember being very confused as to how to do my laundry. Then we had to go back to the auditorium and all watch a movie. It was the freshmen class doing a skit about how much they hated Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Weird...then there was this woman who looked like Mary Poppins. She had a butterfly costume on and was asking this man in the audience to marry her. He said he would do anything but marry her. Then she flew off with the rest of the butterflies. Then someone shot her down. A boy ran to her fallen body and opened up her wings. They were beautiful. I took them and left the auditorium away from everyone else. A little girl ran up behind me and tried to take the wings. They ripped a little bit, but I gave them to her. I was yelled at for this. I went to shower and realized that one of my shoes was gone. I went to the locker room and looked for it. But it wasn't there. So I never found it, but I remember seeing the boys going to soccer practice.]]></report>

I went down there and people were playing card games. But the people weren't real. I guess I just asked why the people weren't real. Someone told me that James Bond was impersonal. So the fake people represented the superficiality of them. I went back upstairs. Then I was trying to watch a movie, but my brother and Wyatt were shooting hockey pucks all over the place and I couldn't do whatever it was I wanted to do. I was really frustrated.

Then when we got back to school, Caleb was going to go with the Varsity Girls team to their game. I was kind of upset and volunteered to drive the bus to the game so that I could be with him. Then I realized that I didn't know how to drive. The bus keeled over and Matthew came to save us. At the hockey rink, Lou was tickling me and flirting with me, and he hurt his back. I traveled to the hospital in the ambulance with him, and kissed his chest over and over again, hoping that would help in some way. Then I was just so mad about Caleb that I kept throwing things around and stomping on them. I was in a rage because he had ditched me earlier. Then I woke up.]]></report>

I remember wanting to go home really badly but I couldn't until my laptop shut down. The big scary random guy kept coming on to me and trying to get me to take my clothes off. He was trying to rape me, and I was really scared. So I tried to call my father, but all the numbers on the phone had been rearranged, so I couldn't figure it out. The guy was chasing after me, telling me that he was just fooling around. I started to cry, and finally I was able to call home. But I didn't know where I was! My father kept asking me where he should pick me up, and all I could say was that I was somewhere in the mountains. It was awful. The guy caught me and hung the phone up. But then Caleb came in and hit the guy and saved me. He brought me to his car and we drove for a long time. We finally got to a motel type place attached to school. Hugh started making fun of me, and I hit him square in the chest. He grabbed my hand and pulled me really close to him. Our foreheads were touching and we were about to kiss, but I was still so upset about that scary guy that I ran away. I ran into Mr. Lopez, who tried assigning me more geometry homework. I tried to do it, but it was really difficult. Everyone around me kept trying to mess me up, so I was running away, holding onto my geometry homework. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I first dreamed that I was in chemistry, when I realized my entire schedule had changed. I was in none of the same classes, but my entire schedule was somehow filled up. I had the opposite lunch period from all my friends, and Billy Joel was my college advisor. Then I was in my room sorting my bras, and I couldn't find the white one I was looking for. Then, I dreamed that I was sailing in the pool. There were 3 different kinds of boats, and I didn't know which one to use, so I asked Caleb. Pete, Sam, and some other guys kept trying to listen, so Caleb waited until they went away so he could tell me which boat to use. I distinctly remember putting my hand up to cover my mouth, even though he was the one who was whispering. Our mouths were really close again, but we pulled away before anything happened, I guess. Next, I was at some swim meet and there were bookshelves lined up for bleachers. They were really narrow, so I kept falling off onto the pool deck. People laughed at me when I fell. Mason and Isaiah were sitting on the bookshelf with me and they finally fell too when the whole thing toppled into the water. Then I lived in this house of grime. I lived right next to some huge factory, so all the dirt, grime, smoke, and ash from the factory made a film over my house. It was really disgusting. Then I woke up.]]></report>

When I got to school, it was like a bar. The lights were dim and there was cigarette smoke everywhere. My father and I looked at a Patagonia catalog, trying to find clothes that wouldn't bother my boils. I woke up scratching myself to try and make them go away, and was SO happy when I didn't actually have boils!]]></report>

I was walking back with someone, and I guess I had a date to this dance, but I think I still needed a dress and shoes. Then it was the beginning of the year because we were all moving into Bundy again. Hannah had totally changed the room around. Then we were in the dining hall eating really good French toast. Sue was eating raisin bran. We wondered if when we were juniors we would change seats in the dining hall. I wanted more French toast, but they had run out of syrup. I had to pack my laptop up to get more. On the way, I saw Kevin dressed as a huge bug. He said, "Hi, Bea," and I said, "Nice antennae." So then I went back to my seat and all last year's seniors were back. I tried to get the syrup, but they were taking it all. So then Sue and Charla and I were supposed to meet up later, but I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was in Post, but instead of looking for Caleb, I was looking for Bud. I saw him sleeping in his room and I guess he must have looked really hot, because all of a sudden, I started liking him. Then I was taking a Spanish quiz with some other kids in my class, and we were on a raft in the middle of some bay. An alligator kept dragging us into the water and when one of us would try to save the other, the alligator would grab us. So then I was in the parking lot of CVS in a huge black suburban. I wasn't supposed to be out late at night and was horrified to see my father, because he would probably yell at me for being out past my curfew. I tried to drive away, but realized that I couldn't drive. I ran Freddie Prinze Jr. over on my way home. I was horrified, but apparently he was OK. He said really sarcastically, "Thanks, Bea. Thanks a lot." I was so happy that he knew my name, but sad that I had run him over!]]></report>

I had been asleep that night when some boy came into my room and wrote his name, address, and phone number on my ceiling. Apparently he was initiating some important moment, but I didn't understand. We then talked about terrorist bombings in Rome and Angels and Demons. I also dreamed that there was a TV show about killing wild cats. And I was on it, except I had no weapons!

Leanne was complaining that this was unfair because no one else had to wake up, so she demanded that the entire school wake up at 6am as well. I turned to her and snapped, "It's going to be really unfair when you get into Princeton because of your lacrosse skills, when far more deserving people get turned down, especially when they are much smarter than you!" That shut her up! Then I had a dream that I was in a store and had a fixed amount of money. I bought a pink iPod and a bottle of Chanel perfume. Then I decided to buy different perfume. And then I woke up, but had none of my purchases!]]></report>

Everyone around me was walking up the hill, and I became really mad because I thought I was going to miss the exam. I guess I was rooming with Victoria, because she was there too. I never made it to the AP, so I had to take it online during the summer. Then I had this power that I could make people fall in love with whomever they wanted. And then I woke up.]]></report>

Haley and I were the only ones in the class who knew and we both freaked out and ran away. We were on a train somewhere, a really huge train, like the size of a mall. I somehow knew the train was going to be hijacked, so we got off at Ed's house. There, I made plans for us to get picked up. When I went to get out of bed (that's where I was emailing from, I guess), I discovered that I was naked. I found some way to trick Ed into not looking at me while I ran away. I found a pay phone, but I needed 12 quarters to make a call. I wanted to call my mother to tell her I would be home late, but then I heard her calling my name, and I think she was in real life, which is why I woke up.]]></report>

So we were in the dining hall (my friends and I), and I guess we were studying for exams. But Orlando walked up to our table and pulled me away. I guess he needed me to fix his shirt collar or trim his hair, because all of a sudden we were alone in the corner. I kissed Orlando. After that, he kept chasing me everywhere. Then I had another dream that I was hanging out with Jackson, just walking around and messing around and kissing, but then I looked at my watch and realized it was almost midnight. I had forgotten my curfew. I tried to take a train home and my father told me I should have been home earlier because I had to babysit that night. The kids wanted to rescue this horse, but it was out of Beauty and the Beast, the scene where all the wolves attack the beast, and Belle has to save him. So they finally went inside and had breakfast. Later I played soccer with Sue.]]></report>

We couldn't get away so we went to this Christmas store where they were taking pictures. We thought we would blend in because Tyler was wearing green, and it was Christmas.

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I dreamed I was cross-country skiing to Gavin and Pete's room in Taylor. They were sharing a room, I guess, and I had to get bandages for someone. I thought it was ok to leave the dorm after check-in since I was trying to help someone else. Mrs. Crank was prowling Taylor and caught me hiding under Pete's bed. Although I thought it was OK, I still felt like I was doing something wrong. So then I was sent home for breaking check-in, and my father got really mad at me and lecture me in front of the whole boys' varsity hockey team. I was really embarrassed. Then I was at the refuge in the mountains with him and the boys' hockey team. A bus stopped and Lou got out. His footsteps made so much noise because he had gotten fat over the summer. Then my father was reading an updated version of The Great Gatsby, which was actually about Lou and me, and everything worked out in the end, and no one died. My favorite passage about their first kiss and the tuning fork (in the real book), had been rewritten about LOU giving me this look and me crying because he was convinced that he didn't like me. But then we got together in the end. That night I had to clean up the refuge for dinner. I began sweeping and mopping and Sophia got mad at me because she thought she had cleaned earlier, and that I was only cleaning because I thought she had done a bad job. So she got really pissed off. That night there was a big winter carnival with all sorts of sports games going on. Caroline wanted me to come watch her swim meet, but I wanted to watch the boys' hockey game. I went and remembered seeing Lou skate out onto the ice. I guess I started a new dream, because I was all of a sudden drafted for some war against England. My canon was stuck and I was so terrified. Then I got shot in the leg. I somehow ran to a boat collecting people, and Lou was there too for Christ's sake. We ended up in the Bermuda Triangle, where we got lost. The compass pointed north no matter we turned, so we had no idea how to get anywhere. We ended up pretending we were Peter Pan and Captain Hook fighting, and then I woke up.]]></report>

Jessica only painted one side, and Jackson was really mad. So I defended Jessica by saying, "Just because you can't get with her doesn't mean you have to be mean to her!" That shut him up! Then we rode our horses upstairs to the chairs outside the history wing. My mother was there, as well as all these mountain goats. Ben kept teasing the goats. Then I woke up.]]></report>

I also dreamed that everyone from my Spain group was at the refuge, and this giant snake was slithering around the room and I was just freaking out. But then Tom told me it was OK, and that it was actually Ben who was the snake. Then Ben turned him into a human, and I was so relieved. He told me the history of this witch put a spell on him when he was two years old so that he could only be human half of his life, and then he had to be a snake for the other half. Megan and I thought that was very sad, and then I woke up.]]></report>

The driver was crazy and kept saying, "This train will not crash," but we were all still horrified. Then I had a dream that all of the kids on my Spain group went to the same high school I woke up on the first day and tried a million outfits, but ended up ruining them because I'd drop mascara on them. Then finally I put on jeans and a pink shirt and a jean jacket, before realizing that I shouldn't wear a jean jacket with jeans. On the bus to school, I saw the Chloes. Mr. Chloe was really happy about their new baby. It began to rain. At school I realized I had no makeup on. Then I woke up.]]></report>

Jessica was having her birthday party, but I had to stay at someone else's house. I called my father since I knew he was in the house where we are now. I asked him to call Hannah to ask if I could stay there. Then I saw Claudia, and just ended up staying with her. Sue was taking AP Modern European history again with a Buddhist teacher who served tea and taught them Chinese.

			<report><![CDATA[I first dreamed that Sue and I lived on Bundy 3 and we wanted to go work out. I couldn't find shorts, but finally I did. I grabbed chapstick and my iPod and went to work out. While I was in the shower, Delia asked me to watch Zoey playing tennis downstairs. I thought that was really weird, and didn't care about going to watch tennis. I went home and got online. I was stuck online all night, and I just couldn't sign off --it was very frustrating. Then, all of a sudden, I was in Spain again with my family and I had to tell this Spanish guy a story about a man who ordered salmon, but really wanted soup, and had to change his order. I remember having a lot of trouble conjugating decir. So then our whole group was in Slate, which was in a huge hospital in the center of Madrid. Valerie was with Tom. We all had to shower in these old bathtubs before catching our flight home. When we got into the shower, I realized that I didn't have shampoo or conditioner or anything. I went through a mirror to get out and found myself in the middle of the hospital. I kept running around trying to find Slate so that I could catch my flight. My father was there too because he was trying to give me my mail before I left. And my brother was there too. We all started to climb this really unsteady driftwood ladder. We all fell, but my father caught me, and I was supposed to catch my brother, but I missed, and he fell so far. He just kept falling and falling and falling and cracked his skill when he hit the ground. I was crying so hard. We tried to bring him to the ER. He ended up going blind, never to play hockey again. I woke up because I was crying! Ahh!]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I had moved back into Bundy with Camilia and we had an awesome room. Dorothy was our proctor and it just generally felt like it was going to be a good year. Then I had to go teach Sue and her dad how to play a combination of poker and gin right outside Langton. During the game, I realized that I had a field trip now. I ran back to the dorm and Sue was my roommate and all the furniture had been rearranged. I was really confused, but needed to pack for my field trip. I packed jellybeans and my ipod that was pink and also doubled as a hairdryer. Then I was home and had to get to school fast because I only had 2 minutes until 8am, when the bus for my field trip was leaving. My mother was pulling out of the driveway, and I kept waving at her to make her stop, and she finally did, but told me that if I wanted a ride I needed to get her the 2 Siamese kittens from the garden. I'm pretty sure I missed the field trip. Then I was a rabbit, and I was in the woods. The other rabbits were planning my funeral for the next day. They kept calling it my wedding though. I had decided myself though that I should have a funeral tomorrow though, because there was this bad rabbit that was going to hurt me. I was choosing the flowers before getting fed up with everything and just buried myself alive. How scary!]]></report>

Anyway, we were making a huge mess, and Jessica started ripping things off the wall. She kept saying something like, "Well it's not like the teacher's out there or anything." And of course, when I opened the door, Mrs. Montana was standing there and was very angry with us. She told us to clean everything up. I ate all her food and she just gave me a disappointed look, but I didn't care for some reason. Then I was at the beach with Alexis and Pauline, and Pauline had to come stay with me for 2 weeks. We were going to hang out and have fun! We were talking about our AP scores, and she got a 1, which I had found odd. Finally, I was online in the dining room where our piano is, and there was a huge storm outside. I was planning to meet all my friends at this baseball game, but the power kept going out, so I kept getting disconnected. I ran outside because I had to go save Mason. And then Anthony sent me a back-to-school package.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I keep having this recurring dream that I am on Law and Order: SVU and I have to catch a serial rapist/killer. He always uses this particular knife that has a blue handle. I keep walking through all these houses, turning over tables, trying to find his next victim. Then I see this blue handled knife on the table in the last house, and I realize that I am the next victim. I open my mouth to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel like I'm choking and can't breathe at all. I always wake up gasping for air. It's always the same though.]]></report>

I stroked his chest and then went to take my exam (what is my problem!?). Then I was in some huge house and it was all metal and connected to the athletic center. I had to go to a certain college, and my father was driving along a very precarious and windy road. I was watching him driving for some reason, when I think I was supposed to be in the car. We were on the golf course, on the 6th fairway. Then my brother woke me up this morning.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was in school and was married to James Franco, and that I didn't really realize it. All these girls were all over him, but he didn't do anything because he was married to me. But then we got into a fight because apparently we weren't having sex often enough. But I didn't even think we had yet in the first place. Then Ava and Jon were there, recruiting me to do some sort of skin research. We went to a fancy skin care lab to see how pimples formed and how to attack them. Then I got really tired, realized it was 2:45am, and decided to go to bed. And then I woke up mid-dream (within my real dream) to see that my whole body was covered in jewels. Then I woke up in real life.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had a lot of dreams last night, about science class, oddly enough. The first was that Mr. Frank was my teacher and he had had another son and wanted me to go change its diaper. So Alexis and I brought him to the bathroom to change him. Right before we were leaving, though, I thought Alexis was holding onto him, so I let go and he fell, hit his head, and passed out. It was horrible. Then my final project for science was to do research on Jennifer Lopez, and present her success in terms of biology to a committee who wanted to figure out how to better market her. Anyway, I had forgotten my workbook, so I wasn't able to do that. Then Ross, from Friends, was my teacher, and he was leaving. I had had a crush on him or something, because I was really sad. He rocked me in his arms for a long time, and then left. I wrote his email address down from the board Later, I found out he had slept with some girl, so I told her that the other night, he had slept with another one of his students, so she got upset. Then I had a dream that I had to protect Annakin Skywalker and Padme before their wedding. It was really horrible because people kept shooting them, and I was usually in the way. Then I turned into Flounder from The Little Mermaid and I was paid $5000 to persuade an alligator to ambush the wedding.]]></report>

Anthony visited me, and he was wearing a maroon college sweatshirt. Sue also had a boyfriend over. I asked Anthony to come sleep with me, but he refused because he had a paper to write. So this drove me a little crazy and I went to bed angry. And no he did not crawl into bed with me later; he had left the next morning without saying good-bye! I was really mad.]]></report>

I rested my head on his shoulder, and next thing I know, he is kissing me all over! Then Mrs. Glove walked near us and we went to the athletic center to get away from her. Then I was in a huge house with everyone from school. We were watching a movie and I told one of the freshman boys to sit next to me. I slipped off my seat, and everyone started making fun of me for having big boobs. Then all the girls went to shower, but for some reason, Ben was outside the bathroom, so they couldn't. Cecily couldn't work on yearbook, so she asked me too. Then the Nazis were chasing us and it was horrible. Everyone went on a cycling trip without me, and I was left behind with all the Nazis. Thank god I woke up.]]></report>

Then we were driving on windy roads around mountaintops, jumping over abysses like it was a video game.

			<report><![CDATA[First I dreamed that I was in a play directed by Esme, Hannah, and Margo, and I had a lead. I was rehearsing in front of the whole school for some reason. Then there was a magical world and a normal world, and I was part of both. But anytime something bad or scary happened in the magical world, my mother saved me somehow and brought me back to the normal world. There were all these weird curses on people, like they turned into dinosaurs. My brother always disappeared, and I was trying to get a job at the math help center. One time I was really scared, but no matter how hard I tried, my mother didn't come to save me. And then I realized that I had to save my mother. People kept asking me questions, so in real life I yelled, "I don't know!" and I said it in real life too. I just felt so trapped.]]></report>

Then I remember that I had had two shots of vodka, two Ibuprofens, and my mother's meds, and I had my period. So in really slow motion, I tried to get to bed to go to sleep. Next I dreamed that I was at the last boys' hockey game, and I had to say good-bye to all my friends. So first I said good-bye to Judith. And Mabel was there, but then she wasn't. Next I said good-bye to Mason, and he was sitting between Vanessa and Beth, both his girlfriends, so I apologized for embarrassing him in front of them. Then I said good-bye to Leo, Ida, Hazel, and Etta, and Wong, who tried to push me off the bleachers. Finally I said good-bye to Arthur, Bud, and Jayden. I looked on the ice and saw Lou, playing defense, and he accidentally let the puck by and spluttered, "It...it wasn't my fault." I felt bad for him and thought, There's so much I want to say right now that can't be said in a letter. Then, very sad, I looked at the rink one last time and left. At home, my father and I had to go get my brother from his hockey game. My father wanted me to drive to get used driving conditions. But before we left my computer malfunctioned and I had about 12 copies of every program on my desktop, which was really annoying. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was in some hospital waiting for my brother because he'd broken his arm. Then this guy (who was a lot older than I) sat down next to my father and me and began to flirt with me. My father got annoyed and told him to piss off, which he did. But then his friends came and tried to assault my mother. So I told the nurse, and she made them leave. Next, I found a scooter, and started scootering around the hospital. Then this little boy borrowed it from me and broke his leg. Later, I decided to give the scooter to him, before I realized that he was paralyzed for life. This made me cry. My next dream was that we came home from Italy and had 5000 phone messages, but they were all just recordings of Harry Potter. I tried to check my email, but my computer had broken.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[First I dreamed that Kylie and I went to another one of Jon's parties, this time with more people from my high school. There were so many people there that they made us get into two lines, 1 of boys, and 1 of girls. Whomever we matched up with next to us was our hookup partner for that night. I got someone gross, so Kylie and I left to go home and watch a movie. I went to work out the next day, and there was a hockey camp there. There were lots of boys in the gym, and I was a little intimidated. Finally, I dreamed that I was a beautiful princess and I was at the beach. I saw a Norwegian prince and we fell in love at first sight. But it was like Romeo and Juliet, and our parents didn't want us to be together, so we had to run away and hide at the New York Times, where I had to write an article about us eloping.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[First I dreamed that I was in Tudor England (the class), but I didn't have the right textbooks, so Mr. Bailey gave me his old ones. Then at the end of class, it was the last day of school, because I went back to my dorm room (which I shared with my brother for some reason), and then realized I needed to gather my stuff from everywhere else. So I went back to Tudor England to get my books, returned to my dorm room, and then needed to go back to get my yearbook. When I got back to the classroom, Ian was there, and he kept trying to kiss me. I think he might have if my father hadn't been there. Apparently my father and mother were taking us out to coffee to celebrate the end of the year. So he went to wait in the car. I said good-bye to Lucas and left. I ran into Willis, whom I had a long good-bye with. He told me his sister was hurt, and for the life of me, I couldn't remember her name. I kept thinking it was Amy, and not until I woke up did I remember it was Arlie. I got back to my room and my brother was packing. I had a million emails to read, but I deleted half of them. Just then, I heard a horn honking and knew it was my mother and father outside. They told us they were taking us somewhere in the city. I was reluctant to go because the next morning was the first day of the next school year. Before we left though, I had to return to elementary school to get my writing portfolio from 4th grade. After I found Mrs. Jones and got my writing portfolio, the guy who looked like Jude Law in the airport was there and said he loved my writing. The next day was proctor retreat and I had to swim in the lake with Tuck while Mrs. Carter told me being a proctor was a useless job anyway.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[First, I dreamed the 2005 prom was at our house. I got asked several times and ended up going with Lance. At the end, Lou got up to play a song (I was already over him) and he sang this beautiful love song to Marion. So that made me sort of sad, but I told myself I'd gotten over him anyway. And then Lance told me that it had actually been my name there in the song, but that Lou had changed it last minute because he didn't want me to know how he felt. So I decided to tell him instead. I knew he was in my brother's old room and the poor guy couldn't go to sleep because he was in there with some girl. I knocked on the door and said, "Excuse me, you can't be in there and you need to come out now. We won't watch you come out, but you need to." I was hoping that by hearing my voice, Lou would tell me he loved me. But instead he said, "We'll get out as soon as you make us a hotel reservation and bring us some fiber pills." At this, I thought my mother was in there because she takes fiber pills, so I wrenched the door open, and sure enough, Lou was lying there with my mother. Horrified, I slammed the door and started yelling, crying, and screaming. Lou didn't seem to care. I ran downstairs to get a phone book and threw it onto the bed yelling, "Make your own stinking, dirty hotel reservation" and all he did was laugh. I was so upset that I begged Sue to let me stay at her house. She was already having a sleepover with Hannah, so I slept in the living room. Mrs. Dunn made sure I had everything I wanted, and Mr. Dunn asked me about my college search. Sue had already gotten in somewhere, I think. The next morning we all went to Yuma, and I told them how everything was on sale. I bought a white bikini, and everyone else got shampoo and shoes. Olivia turned up later, back from Spain, but we didn't have any time to talk. Finally, I went home and on my computer was an IM chat from Tyler that said, "I can't help myself, or you." So I asked him what he meant, and he said he loved me. Then I woke up.]]></report>

Then we were all sitting in class and Mr. Winter called me on a phone at my desk and told me I had to tell Dorothy she was going to die in 3 hours. So I freaked out and started sweating and shaking and yelled to Dorothy to get to a hospital. Hannah was there, gossiping. Next we were all in the dining hall, and I was sitting with Alexis, Pauline, Faith, and Kylie. I was asking Faith and Kylie about the parties they had been to while I had been in Italy.]]></report>

I couldn't figure out how to break up with him. My father wanted to take a book out of the library for me on James Dean, but it turns out he had to buy it since it was a Roman library or something. Next, we were all at school, but it was a girl's school and Mrs. Persky and Mr. Chloe were married. Hermione had hooked up with Sirius and then Sirius had died, like in Harry Potter. Everyone was really mad at Hermione. And then there were some other dreams in there about Lou.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I had a dream that we were still in Italy on some secret boat chase. We docked in Rome and I got together with 30 other people my age, which I sort of knew, but not that well. Then we got home and had to go to school. I realized I was naked when I got to school, so I tired to stay behind and get dressed, but wasn't embarrassed at all. While I was trying to get into my pink corduroys and a white polo shirt, I thought of all the ways I could try to get Lou's attention. There was a puppy that was trying to attack me while I was getting dressed. Finally, we left the chapel and went outside where everyone was singing hymns. My mother had to call my father to discuss dinner plans, since I had a hockey game. I went to lunch and sat with Olivia. I noticed Andrea at the table next to Lou at a nearby table, so I rushed at Andrea screaming, and Lou noticed and Andrea got mad. Then I saw Valerie and Ashley.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I had the worst dream of my life. First I was near the senior steps by the back of the dining hall, and my brother fell and landed with what I kept repeating in my head as "a sickening crunch." It was horrible. He had to be dead. Then I came home and my father had to fight these monsters working with Voldemort in the lake. He had a gun that looked like the remote control, and he got frustrated when I couldn't understand how it worked. I cut up his purple and white boxers to use as Clothies, because I didn't know when I'd see him again. My mother was tanning on the deck and I went inside the kitchen to be sad about my father leaving. I noticed the creamer standing outside the pantry. Slowly, it turned to face me. I got so scared. Fritz was evil and rabid and working with this creamer, trying to prove that my mother and I were anorexic. I ran upstairs because I was so scared. I went into my brother's room and jumped into his bed, nearly hysterical with fear, begging him to let me sleep there. My brother had this nail in his back, which I guess was serving as his stitches. The evil Fritz came in with the creamer and ripped the nail out of his back, and I screamed. Apparently, the nail was a family heirloom of Slytherin. There was also a cactus on my brother's bedside table, and it was a Horcrux that Voldemort used. He recovered because all of a sudden, he and Russell and Ted and I were all on the run from Voldemort. We were running around London and my high school, which was in London, trying to escape. We ran into my room and my roommate was Ron. Hector was chasing us too. He wanted to kill my baby, because apparently I was pregnant. We are running everywhere and Ginny started to slow down. I started freaking out, but saw this French marching band on the Spanish Steps (I guess we got to Rome somehow). The band members were all dressed in brightly colored robes and were supposed to help us, but they didn't. They just kept playing their instruments and waving their flags. We tried to save my mother and get back to school. Then I was supposed to go on a date with Pete. This was right after hockey practice, so I went to the bathroom to try and primp myself. For some reason, I wet my pants, but it didn't matter. I came out and Ian began pouring his heart out, telling me I was the only one for him, and that he loved me. But I was still so scared that I ran to my high school and burst into tears and I woke up crying.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My first dream was that I was researching something in the library and it closed early, so I had to leave and go to lunch. The dining hall was huge --like the size of Grand Central. Gary was doing some sort of dance, and Sue was trying to talk to me while I got raspberry and mandarin orange flavored avocados. There was a live band there for some reason. Before I knew it, however, I was in New York babysitting this boy, Preston. He had myspace and 2 of his friends were coming over to play. But I couldn't find Preston. His friends arrived, a brown haired girl and a boy who looked much older than Preston. The boy was German and had an older brother my age. The brother was really cute and asked me to watch his brother for an hour or so. I gave up on Preston and watched the German boy instead. Finally the older brother came back after having coffee, and we all took the train back to my school's state. Then I went back to the city and was living in an apartment. Across the street Jennifer Garner taught 3rd grade. Ben Stiller was living with me and wanted to go to Jennifer's classroom. They met on the side of the street and she loved his poodle, Fluffy. They agreed to meet later for an ice cream. This train ran into my apartment and ruined everything. My mother and I were scrambling out. In the scuffle, we lost Fluffy, but we found Skye and Fritz, who were alive. We stepped onto the street and the cute German boy saw me. His mother thought I was Swedish. My brother was hanging around by the train wreck, and my father, my mother, and I all drove over to take him away. He wanted to show off in front of Francine and her friends, so he hopped in backwards through the window. Then I woke up.]]></report>

So we did, but then we had to leave to go bake cookies or something. Then it was the last day of school, and everyone rushed out of main building to the music building, where we had to listen to a concert. Everyone kept sliding down the side of the hill. All of a sudden, I was in the alumni house with a Spanish home stay family (and I communicated with them in Spanish in my dream). Margo was there and we were looking for ice cream, before I realized I had to be babysitting. I ran into the main building and went down to the English wing, where there was a talk about college. The bell rang and I had to run up to the history wing, where I knew no one. Then I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am returning to Mary's sister Kathy's house. I think Kathy is in this dream, but I can't see her. When I enter the house I see Mary, full face, as she is portrayed in her "Glamour" photo. She isn't exactly looking at me. I am surprised and excited to see her and say something like, "How come you're here? You're not supposed to be here. You're dead. How did you get here?" I know I am delighted to see her, but am surprised that she has returned. But as I speak, her face changes from a most beautiful complexion (as it had been before her death) into a waxen, artificial, dead face -- as one sees after the mortician has dressed a body.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In this dream our sofa is pulled out from the wall and is standing in the center of the room, its back facing the kitchen. Mary is lying on the sofa and I can see her in profile. She is sad. Maria, Robert, Adam and I are around her and looking down at her. It seems that she is saying that no one loves her. All of us hasten to assure her that we love her and each of us in turn declares our love for her. Then I name off all of the other people who love her, beginning with her sister, Kathy. She changes the subject and says that she's cold and in distress (much as she was in the latter days of her illness). I ask her if she would like the heating pad. Her face lights up with her beautiful smile, and she replies, "That would be nice." I go over to the hutch to get it when I suddenly realize that I haven't taken the heating pad out of the hutch drawer since Mary died. I'm startled and terribly sad and upset. I'm in two time dimensions at once. I am in the present (or is it the past?) with Mary; and I am also in the future -- in a time after Mary's death. My heart is breaking and I begin to cry uncontrollably. I think I am carrying the heating pad over to Mary, but I'm so overwhelmed by my tears that I'm not clear where she and the children are located.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In this dream, which is hard to recapture or describe, it seemed it took place in this apartment in Trinidad that my daughter and I had rented, as well as in its vicinity. I didn't actually see anyone in the dream -- just the rooms and furnishings -- but no people. The "we" I refer to as I record this dream are Mary, me, Maria and her girlfriend. The general "plot" or "theme" of this dream is that Mary has returned to our apartment after shopping and starts preparing a meal for us in the apartment kitchen. I am very concerned and upset that Mary is doing these things because I know she is very weak. I try urging her to stop and to rest, but she is paying no attention to me and just continues preparing the meal. I return to the dining room, then hear a strange noise - sounds like someone falling on the floor, or like the sound of toast when it is done and pops up in the toaster. I run to the kitchen, but don't look on the floor but at the counter on which the toaster stands. The toast is burned and an empty teapot is turned on its side. I just feel something terrible has happened. Then, although that part of the dream is over, I see, in the dream, I'm lying in bed and crying uncontrollably.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[It seemed there is a woman in our kitchen. (I'm sure it isn't Mary, but I wonder). She is standing by the portable dishwasher, which is connected to the sink by a hose. Suddenly the lights go out. There are several light fixtures in the kitchen. One is on the wall over the sink, another is on the opposite wall, and there are others elsewhere in the room. They are in the style of old-time lanterns and some look like candles. I am frightened by the lights flickering on and off, but don't know why this frightens me. When the lights are on, they give off only a dim light. A small child is running about (in what appears to be our apartment). I am lying in bed (sleeping?) but unable to move. I am completely immobilized.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[We are either on a holiday, or in some kind of sanatorium. At any rate, in this dream I know Mary is ill and we are not able to (or we are not permitted to?) make love, or even allowed to tell each other that we love one another. I'm sort of lying down or am in a sitting position where I'm looking up at Mary. It is hard to tell whether we are indoors or outdoors, but it is very bright and sunny. Mary is standing, looking up at the sun. Her hands are raised above her head as though she is reaching for the sky. She is looking up, but her eyes are closed, and she is making low sounds, like she's praying. At the same time, she is doing a slow, weaving dance as though she is making a supplication to God. I have a strong desire to hold her and I do so. I stand up, put my arms around her and begin to kiss her face, eyes, cheeks, neck and her breasts. But all the while she continues her slow, sinuous dance with her head and arms uplifted, chanting what I believe to be prayers - and completely oblivious to me. I joined the dance in order to hold on to her - to kiss her.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I have to get up to go to the bathroom (again?) for a drink of water. The dream bathroom is exactly the same as my real bathroom, except that it has a window in the wall opposite the doorway. But this dream is so real that I actually believe it is not a dream. As I am drinking, something (a presence?) begins shaking me. My entire body shakes from my head to my toes -- at first gently, but soon, more violently. When the shaking starts, I am surprised, and initially not frightened. I think I call out, "Is that you, Mary?" But when the shaking becomes more violent, I become very frightened. I know this is not Mary, but some terrifying and evil force. I must break away from this powerful grip. I think, if only I can escape its hold on me and scream, this will get Adam's attention and I'll be safe -- or saved. I don't know how I do it, but somehow I break from the grip of this force. Then, slowly, I back out of the bathroom, and out of the bedroom and into the hall. All this while I keep my eyes focused in the direction of where I think the evil force is located. I do not see "The Thing," but I am convinced that it is moving menacingly towards me. All this while I am convinced this is not a dream -- that it is real. I'm making a terrible noise that is coming from deep down in my throat. It is an anguished moan, and sounds like, "Ooo -- ooo --ooo," repeated over and over again. I'm desperately hoping to awaken Adam, whose bedroom is just next to mine. The door of his room is closed and I'm very upset that he's sleeping so soundly and not coming to my rescue. At no time do I think of Robert as my potential rescuer. His bedroom is just next to Adam's. All of my thoughts are only on waking up Adam. It is a terrifying ordeal and I'm extremely frightened.]]></report>

I know it is Mary. There is something that appears to be a bandage around her head or on her face. I ask her if she's all right. She replies, "Yes," I a plaintive voice. I don't think I call her by name when I see her at the other end of the room/ hall. I think I greet her with, "Is that you, Doll (or Honey)?"

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are going somewhere -- a short weekend trip -- perhaps to Montreal. On our way we meet a group of friendly soldiers. There are about 6 or 7 of them. They invite us to join them, assuring us that they will get us to our destination at no cost to us. So we join them. They take us aboard a ship. Once aboard, someone tells us right away that this ship will take us where we want to go, but there will be a one-day stopover at another place/city on the way. We are disappointed. Also, we feel out of place because everybody is in uniform and we are not. However, there is a swimming pool on the ship and we are pleased to see other civilians. They are the officers' wives and their children. I talk to some children while Mary quickly engages in conversation with the women. But throughout this dream I am worried about Mary's health. I keep asking her how she is and she keeps insisting that she is OK. I am wearing bathing trunks under my pants, but I never do go in the pool. I tease the children that I will go in the pool, and open the top button of my fly to show them that I do, indeed, have on bathing trunks. But I don't go swimming. At one point during the dream it is raining and miserable. This was just before we met the wives and children at poolside. There is a scene where we climb down a flight of stairs and traverse a catwalk or walkway that runs along the outside hull of the ship. It is via this catwalk that we get to the swimming pool.]]></report>

I see on her abdomen a large white spot (of disease and decay? I don't know). The message she gives me is that she knows she is going to die from the illness, but she is accepting of her death, and she wants me to be happy. Although there is no mention of Bonnie and my forthcoming marriage to her, it seems that Mary is giving me her approval to go ahead and get married and have a happy life. In this dream Mary has her original and beautiful long, dark hair. She is wearing it in an upswept style. Her face is beautiful. She is not wearing the colostomy bag.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are at a movie and the picture is supposed to be some kind of erotic film. If I remember correctly, there is a scene in the movie where several women are wearing masks. But the masks are actually massagers or vibrators. The women close in on a man -- or men -- embrace him/them and press their massagers/vibrators against him/them. In the dream, this struck both Mary and I as very silly -- hardly erotic at all. Mary is laughing and is in good spirits. She turns to me, and says, in high glee: "I like fucking and sucking, but that's something else." We decide to leave the movie -- it's so stupid. And as I'm sitting beside Mary, laughing and enjoying myself and feeling so very glad to be with her, I suddenly realize she is dead -- has been dead for 15 months. As I think about this in the dream, I am aware of thinking also that she's not dead. How can she be dead when she is here beside me, laughing and enjoying herself? In this dream I'm dimly aware of being married to Bonnie, but I'm deeply preoccupied with being with Mary and shocked to remember that she's dead. I'm not accepting that Mary is dead because she's with me.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are sitting at a table, she at one end and I at her immediate left. I can't take my eyes off her. She is radiantly beautiful. Both of us know she is fatally ill and going to die. But she appears as I remembered her before the illness, except that she is paler. It were as though the disease has not yet begun to cause her severe damage and distress. Mary is laughing and chatting and charming. Other people are also sitting at the table, but I'm not sure who they are. As the dream begins, Mary is talking to Adam (who appears to be about 10 years old). I cannot see him. He has a dog, and Mary, laughing, tells him the dog stinks and should be examined by a veterinarian. As Adam and his dog go away, Mary bows her head, and in a low voice, says, "I hope they keep that dog locked up for 2 years." Both of us know Mary doesn't have 2 years to live. I study her face thoroughly, looking for signs of disease or any indication that she may be in pain. I think I see a lump on her face, but I am wrong. What I see is her eyelid. She looks at me and we tell each other, "I love you." Mary knows I have remarried. Somehow, Mary and I had arranged to have our marriage annulled. (In the dream this seems so logical, but upon awakening, it made no sense to me at all). I think I ask Mary if she likes Bonnie and I also ask her to tell me what she thinks of Bonnie. But Mary is noncommittal. She merely laughs and chats on about other things. I am so delighted to see Mary.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary is "doing" her hair. She had let it down and is busy putting it up again. In the process, her arms tire and she gets "fed up." And just as I remembered her, she makes a remark that describes her frustration. She stops working on her hair and rests awhile. Then she continues again. She takes several more rest stops before completing the styling to her satisfaction. We are in an extremely large, rambly, old, dark house. It is not well furnished. We are hurrying to go somewhere -- to a funeral(?) We had to be there at 5:45 p.m. and it is already 6:00 p.m. We are late. Another scene in this dream shows Mary and I searching through the house, looking for our clothing. As well, we are worried about Robert. He's just a little boy and is missing. We can't leave the house until we find him. Suddenly Robert appears as a grown man, as he is today. He comes over to me, smiles, lays his hand on my arm and assures us that he's OK.]]></report>

I cannot see her face clearly. My eyes first take in her hair. It is in the upswept style she is fond of, in which her long hair is rolled around a "rat" at the back of her head. It gives fullness and body to her hairdo. Then I catch a brief glimpse of her eyes. She appears to be disguised as a Japanese woman (a Geisha Girl?).]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I see Mary very clearly, as she appeared before the illness. She is very beautiful, is smiling and happy. We are having a long conversation. I am able to touch her. I think I also hug her and hold her hand. We both know that she is dead. I ask her if she is alright. She assures me that she is fine and happy. I am pleased to know that she is OK. Somewhere I see two of her sisters, but I'm not sure how they "fit" into this dream. I think Mary is concerned about them. She seems to be telling me that her sisters are -- or will be -- OK. Or maybe she is telling me about their health -- that it is unfortunate that they are not well -- but one must accept whatever happens.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a place that is partly a hospital and partly our former apartment. I enter the apartment without Mary knowing I have come in. I am in the bedroom and Mary is elsewhere in the apartment. I do not want to frighten her so I make some sounds -- maybe I call her name -- to let her know I'm in the apartment. We come toward each other in the hall, meeting in the middle of the hallway. We rush into each others' arms, embrace and kiss. Mary doesn't look exactly as I had known her. She is overweight and her breasts are unusually large. But it is Mary and I'm delighted see her, to hold her, and to kiss her. I know immediately that she is undergoing chemotherapy treatment, but has decided to stop taking it. She wants to know where the exact spot is where she'll make the announcement that she's discontinuing this treatment. She is looking for the place, outside the building, to make her last stand.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a place that is a cross between our old apartment and the Idlewoods Avenue flat. The bedroom is similar to the Treefrog address and the hall and bathroom are like the Idlewoods address. I am putting on my shorts. They are torn in the crotch. Somehow I pin it up, but it's not a good "repair" job. I remove the pin(s) and go into the bedroom. Mary is standing there. She appears as she had as a young woman. She is not wearing makeup and her hair is down. I think she is wearing a housedress. When I see her I know she is dead, so I drink in with my eyes all I can see of her. She doesn't know she' dead, so I know I must enjoy every moment I have with her because soon she won't be with me. So I carry on as though this was very normal, and I did not let on to her that she is dead. There is a very serious and thoughtful expression on Mary's face. I tell her about the trouble I am having with my shorts and she agrees to pin this up correctly. But firstly, she wants to know if we still have the two-tone black & silver flatware set. I tell her that I think we still have a couple of these sets in our garage and that I will go and look for them. Mary says she can get 10 dollars for each set from "Cardinal's" (?). I don't think that is much money for them, but I don't object. If she wants to sell them at that price, it's OK with me. Before I can go to the garage, I have to go to the bathroom. I look down the hall in the direction of the bathroom and see a woman seated on the toilet. The bathroom door is open, but the woman's face is somewhat hidden. Then I think I catch a glimpse of her face. It is either Bonnie or Mrs. B (a tenant who had rented a flat in my parents' home a long, long time ago).]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am walking with Mary, who is wearing a white dress. She looks terrific -- as she had prior to the last recurrence of the disease. She has been resurrected for a particular purpose that is not made clear in this dream. I comment on how terrific she looks, even though she had been in the grave only a short while ago. There was no decay nor any indication that she had been dead. But as I speak, I realize I should not have said anything because she doesn't know she had been dead and is now resurrected. My remarks disturb her greatly. Her mood changes from one of smiling happiness into surprised sorrow. Something in her belly begins to bulge and throb. Now I see (or am aware of) a woman hiding at the side of a road, holding a child in her arms. Someone else is at the side of the road, but in the field, behind the woman. This person is spying on her. This spy believes he had seen a man and a woman "sneaking" down in the grass to make love.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a rural area, and the people I see -- farmhands and villagers -- are poor. They are dressed in clothing in the style of the early 1800's. They are dirty and rolling in mud or on the ground. In one scene I see someone wrestling (or playing?) with a small donkey or mule. This person threatens me with this animal, i.e., ordering it to butt or bite me. I am searching for Mary. I know she is purposely hiding from me because she is sick and dying and doesn't want me to see her in this terrible condition. Someone tells me that the "photographer" is hiding her. He is a foreign gentleman who has befriended Mary. He feels very sorry for her and is doing whatever he can to help her. I find the "photographer" and he points to the building where I will find Mary. I enter this building, which looks like an old house or barn. The colors in this dream are various shades of brown or chestnut -- autumn colors. I enter a bedroom and find Mary lying in bed. She covers her head and face when I come in. She is crying. She doesn't want me to see what the illness has done to her. I throw myself on the bed and try to take her in my arms. I lay across her body and cry heart-brokenly. I tell her how much I love her; that she is always beautiful in my eyes. I tell her I don't want her to die. I try to urge her to resume taking chemotherapy. She cries and tells me how terrible it is and how rotten it makes her feel. She wants to die rather than suffer. She tells me she loves me and doesn't want to leave me, but there is no other way. Her suffering is too great and she'd rather die.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary is lying on a couch or bed. She is wearing a nightgown and is covered by a comforter. She is sick and dying. But she is not yet at the advanced stage of the illness because she is not exceedingly thin. Although she is bald and wears a wig, she has good skin color. I can't see her face clearly because her back is toward me. I try to cradle her in my arms and hold her tight, but she pulls away from me and says something about her being "unfuckable." When I hear this, it makes me cry. I assure her that I love her very dearly and that our not having sex doesn't matter to me. In another part of the dream I am going somewhere and doing "things," but I am very much aware of -- and very preoccupied with -- the knowledge that Mary is at home and is very sick. I am very hopeful that she is not going to die, but don't know on what I base this hope. There is a scene in this dream where I am writing names on a Bulletin Board and I'm careful to write only Anglo-Saxon names, preferably names having Irish origins.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a large, rambling, many-roomed building or house. Maria approaches me. She's very excited. She tells me that Mary is back and we are going to see her. Robert and Adam are also with Maria, but I can't see them clearly. Adam appears to be about 6 or 7 years old, when I see him more clearly, later in the dream. Immediately after Maria tells me that we are going to meet Mary, I start a frantic search of the building. I race from room to room. I am looking for something, but don't know what it is I seek. Many questions are running through my mind. "If Mary is dead, how can she come back?" "If she isn't dead, where has she been?" "How do I explain to Mary my marriage to Bonnie?" But no matter what questions come to my mind, I am excited and looking forward joyfully to seeing Mary. Suddenly we are all sitting around the dining room table, including Mary. This is where I have a good chance to see her at close range. She looks terrific. She is just a wee bit pale, but otherwise she is as she had been in 1959, before the second recurrence of the illness. Mary tells us that she had been through numerous operations in order to be restored to good health. All that surgery had been pretty rough on her, but, thank goodness, it's all over except for one more operation. She describes the nature and purpose of the pending operation. The name of the operation is a long one. Either I forget the name, or can't pronounce it. Mary assures us this is a minor operation compared to all the others she's had. And when it'll be done, she'll be OK again. We then realize that we shouldn't be sitting around the table. We're supposed to be in my car. The plan is for us to go somewhere, but I don't' remember where we're to go. I tell the family that I don't have my car because it's in the service station being repaired. It is at this point that I realize that my earlier searching through the house was because I was looking for my car keys. The dream ends when I discover that my car is not available.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[There are two women in this dream. I make love to each of them within a short span of time -- within the same day or maybe within a few hours. I don't know who the woman is that I first make love to. It may be Bonnie. I see myself making love to the second woman. I can't see her face clearly at the outset, but do see her later. I believe it is Mary. I am sure it is Mary. I do not see her face during lovemaking, but do so afterwards. We are making love in a standing position. When I attain an erection, I want to have intercourse in the "doggy" position, with her back to me. Instead of having the woman on her knees, I have her bend forward from the waist. But I lose my erection and cannot penetrate her. We are walking up Idlewoods Avenue. It is now that I see the woman's face. It is Mary.. When I had made lover to her, I told her that this was the second time I'd made love today -- that I had made love to another woman earlier. We walk past a house on Idlewoods where we had had a flat in the early years of our marriage. As we look at the house, the veranda has the appearance of a kitchen sink draining board. It is loaded with plates, one stacked upon the other. They had recently been washed and are glistening with water.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am moving somewhere. I am carrying or moving various parcels from one place to another. These parcels are stacked on the sidewalk of a street. I am showing some people photographs. Many of these pictures are old. I don't recognize any of the people. For a fleeting instant I see myself pulling a suitcase off the road and onto the sidewalk. I see a car standing in the road. Mary's brother, Paul, is in this car. He tells me the suitcase belongs to him. I have a funny feeling that the people to whom I'm showing the pictures may not return them to me. I see a car parked across the road and Mary is sitting inside it. I can see her clearly. She is beautiful. She is dressed in white. I know that she is dead, and that the road between us is the dividing line between Life and Death. I am on the Life side, Mary is on the Death side. She smiles briefly at me, but mostly the expression on her face is serious. We have a conversation, but I cannot see Mary's lips moving. I emphasize that the children are well, particularly Maria. Mary asks me why we hadn't had too much sex during the last couple of years of her life, especially the time before she took ill. While she doesn't spell it out clearly, she appears to wonder if I'm "gay." I start trying to explain things to her. I don't remember what I tell her -- then the dream ends at this point.]]></report>

While I am on my search I know that my family -- including Mary -- are in a car outside waiting for me. But I am preoccupied with trying to find what I'm looking for. I finally decide that I am not going to find what I seek and head for the car. I am too late. From a window in this building I see the car moving away, and everyone in the car is waving at me. Mary is wearing her white duck pants and gray poncho top. Even though I can't see her clearly, I know she is in the car. There is a great sense of loss and disappointment in me that I did not join them in the car sooner.]]></report>

It is a large house and has many rooms, which are bright and airy. There are many people in the house, including the men doing the repair work. Everyone is making a great deal of noise. I get annoyed with one woman who is jumping or dancing and making lots of noise. I ask her to leave. When I tell her about sending the woman home, Mary points out that that woman is the wife of our paperhanger. I don't know whether we laughed at this, but we certainly did not take it seriously. I can't see Mary clearly, but I know it is she. We are young -- in our mid or late 20's. In another dream scene, Mary calls us to dinner. I see two children who appear to be 4 or 5 years old. I assume they are ours, but neither is Maria, Robert or Adam. As we leave one room to get to the dining room, we have to go through a small iron railing. The railing looks familiar to me. I tell Mary that we had had it in storage but retrieved it when we bought this house where we had it installed. We are using the railing as a partition -- much like a safety gate.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and her sister Kathy are busy repairing a carpet in Kathy's home. They are so involved in their task that they have no time for me. So I leave. I walk home along a street in the area where I had lived as a child. The street is very crowded with people and I'm having some trouble making my way through the crowd. It seems that someone touches or pushes me as I am walking, but I am not certain about this detail. Two women are following me, and talking about me. As I am walking, I am worried about where I had left the jacket of one of my suits. I am sure that it is lost and that I'll never find it again. I arrive home and enter our kitchen. It looks like it is freshly painted in an off-white grayish color. Suddenly Mary jumps up from a kneeling position. She had been painting the floor directly underneath the kitchen table. When she jumps up so quickly, she bumps her head on the table. Mary greets me enthusiastically and laughs at the bump raised on her head where it had struck the table. She is wearing a white smock. Her figure is slender and trim. She looks terrific. She is so happy to see me and I am so thrilled to see her. She runs over to me and we embrace. All the while, Mary is laughing and talking. The two women who had followed me on the street come right into our house. I know that they are there and I'm glad they followed me. Now they can see where I live and what a wonderful wife I have. As Mary greeted me, she said something that sounded like, "Don't I have a right to make a dollar...." I can't remember the rest of her statement because I'm awakened by my clock radio. I had seen her for only a fraction of a second before I woke up.]]></report>

Then a woman gets out of our bed and says, "Well, I'll leave you kids to have fun " ... or words to that effect. Mary, laughing, yet partly serious, asks me, "OK, Ed, why don't you tell me the truth?" I'm not sure if that is how she phrased her questionto me, but basically her message to me is that she believes I am withholding some information from her. She is asking me to "come clean" about that "something." I become quite worried. I try to figure out what she's getting at. Then the truth of it all came out. Apparently, whenever I had to urinate, I would tell Mary that I didn't have to go. I would defer going to the toilet as long as I possibly could. I was very relieved to realize that it was a silly issue like this that is troubling Mary. I'd hate to think that Mary believes I'm not totally honest with her.]]></report>

I am trying to hurry her to get ready to go to the beach (I think that is where we are supposed to go). But Mary tells me she doesn't think she can make it. She complains about something in her eye. She is seated and combing -- brushing -- her hair which she has down, around her shoulders. This is the full, frontal view I have of Mary in this dream.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are walking in what looks like the downtown area of our hometown. Mary is very young and beautiful. We are happy and in love and hold hands as we walk. We stop from time to time, embrace, and kiss. These are long, passionate, "French" kisses. We stop kissing and continue our walk down the street. Somehow I know I must initiate a discussion with Mary about her impending death. I have to broach the subject, ask her how she feels about dying, and ask her if she has any last wishes. Does she want to give me instructions about anything she wants arranged after her death? Surprisingly, Mary is receptive to this discussion. My fears concerning her reaction are groundless. Then I commit a terrible mistake by calling her by Bonnie's name. I apologize profusely. I am very upset. But Mary is very gracious and forgiving of my blunder. We continue talking, and again, for the second time, I call Mary by Bonnie's name.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had just moved into a new neighborhood and see an empty garage. A man is inside, just under the ceiling. He appears to be cleaning or repairing it. It occurs to me that I would like to rent this garage. I tell the man I would like to rent the garage and ask where I may find the owner in order to negotiate this. The man is very friendly and tells me I can't rent it because he has recently rented it for himself. At this point I seem to have lost my direction. I am (floating?) up in the air. Ahead of, and below me, I see Mary. She is lying on a lawn and is wearing a reddish colored housedress. Mary is looking up at me and smiling. I have a complete frontal view of her. Her smile is beautiful, and she is looking me straight in the eye. She waves at me and signals directions on how to find my way to her. The dream ends as I am moving towards Mary, who is waving at, and singing to me.]]></report>

She is disfigured. I approach her and remove the bowl from the table before her. It is half filled with a chocolate pudding or custard. Without asking her permission, I take the bowl away from her and wash it out. Mary asks me why I did that because she's eating it. Then she smiles and shows me the cake in her hand.

			<report><![CDATA[I am holding Mary in my arms, but at the same time I see her from a distance. It is Mary, but her face doesn't look like Mary's. Her face is squarish and hollow or emaciated. We both know she is sick. Although I am making love to Mary, I am also doing "the laying on of hands," trying to combat the cancer and to cure her. She accepts my "laying on of hands" -- or at least doesn't resist or protest. I place my hands on her stomach and on her back. I pray that the disease should disappear -- that God's strength and power will wipe out the disease. While I do this, I hear a kind of "popping" noise coming from Mary's body in response to my prayers and to my "laying on of hands." While I feel that I am having some success in fighting the cancer, Mary remains calm and stoical. She neither accepts nor denies that my efforts are helping her. There is a scene in this dream where I am sucking on Mary's nipples, which are quite long and prominent. She quietly asks me to stop because it's hurting her. I stop.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary is wearing the red dress that she had worn at our 25th wedding anniversary. She is smiling and happy and healthy and looks exactly as she had when she was alive and in good health. Her hair is jet black, and her eyes are beautiful brown "sparklers." I have a frontal view of her. We are dancing and just happy to be together. In another scene we are driving in my car and I am going quite fast. Mary tells me I am going too fast and asks me to slow down. To my immediate right is a low stone wall. Although I can't see over it, I know there is a cliff dropping away on the other side of that wall. On my left is a broad expanse of grassland as far as the eyes can see. I veer sharply away from the wall and drive on the grassy plain, in a direction parallel to the wall. The mood of this dream is one of joy and happiness. At one point I see Mary wearing a large red turban. I don't like it and tell her so.]]></report>

I know I am sick and am going to die." And her talk is in this vein. As I hold her I can feel that her body is bloated and unhealthy. I begin to cry and tell her how sorry I am about what is happening to her. She tells me not to cry -- that I am not helping her by crying. She says she needs me to be strong. I can't take this, and I get angry with her. I tell her that I can't always be strong -- that I need to cry to get my anger and sadness out. As soon as I said these things to her, I feel badly that I'm burdening her with my sorrow. I'm not sure how she reacted -- she becomes silent and the dream ends.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am sitting on my sofa, about to engage in masturbation, when suddenly I remember that Mary will soon be getting home from work. I quickly change my plans and decide to have supper ready for her when t she gets home. I enter the kitchen to prepare a meal. But there is a man in there. He has just opened a can of salmon and broken an egg into a soup bowl. I explain to him that it is important that I be able to use the kitchen in order to make supper for Mary. He is reluctant to leave. But another man comes in and explains my situation to him. The first man graciously agrees to leave, telling me I may use the food that he had started to prepare for his own supper. For some reason, both men appear to me to be Russian. Mary arrives home. She has short hair and is wearing a gray suit. We greet each other with spontaneous hugs. I notice that she is in pain and ask her what is the matter. She tells me that she has an infection, but she's been to the doctor and will be OK. I ask Mary if she'd like supper and suggest she lie down while I prepare it. She answers that she would like supper and agrees to rest while I get it ready. All the while, I am wondering how I can use the salmon and egg as ingredients for supper. Mary looks good, although the expression on her face shows that she's in pain. She is her usual sweet, kind, loving and forbearing self -- as I have always known her to be. At the beginning of the dream, I am shocked to think that I could forget about Mary coming home from work.]]></report>

But since her admission, I haven't visited her or phoned the hospital to find out about her condition. I didn't want to know and am pretending that there is no point in contacting the hospital. But Maria asked me if I had phoned the hospital to find out about Mary, and suddenly all my guild comes out. I enter a telephone booth and frantically start looking in the Telephone Directory for the hospital's phone number. I am having difficulty find it. For some strange reason I am searching for the name "FISHMAN" when I know perfectly well that isn't the name of the hospital. I don't know whether she's in Sunnybrook, or Bayview, or where. I am searching anxiously through several phone books. I'm angry at people for not stacking these phone books neatly on the cupboard shelf inside the phone booth. Then I wake up.]]></report>

As I do so, I see on Mary's side of the bed the mattress is broken and it has a large hole there. Next I'm in Mary's hospital room. We embrace before I look at her face. We are standing, and while in a tight embrace, I cry, and declare my love for her, over and over again. She, too, is declaring her love for me. I then look at her for the first time. She is beautiful, and is costumed like Cleopatra (as depicted in a Hollywood movie). She is wearing a headdress and flowers in her hair. She looks absolutely gorgeous -- as she had before the advance of the disease. Mary is smiling and happy. I ask her if she is trying to say goodbye to me. Mary looks puzzled and asks why would I ask her such a thing. I explain that early in our marriage she had dressed up exactly as she is now, and for a very brief time. Now, by the manner of her dress, I wonder if she is trying to tell me something.]]></report>

However, I am eventually successful in doing so. It is only while I am struggling with the dials on the stove that I sense that Mary is somewhere, upstairs, in the house. Next I am in a room trying to take a shower. There are many young men in this room. (I think they are students.) I don't know them, and they don't know me, but it does not seem strange that they are in the house. I am struggling to take a shower and have trouble finding the proper taps to turn on the water.

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are dining in a hotel restaurant. I do not see Mary throughout this dream, but I do know that I am with Mary when we came to dine in this restaurant. The dream begins just after Mary has excused herself to go to the washroom. After a long wait for her return, I am worried. I call the Manager of the hotel and ask him to help me find Mary. We are in a nonsmoking section of the restaurant. Some men take a table close to ours and all of them light up cigars or cigarettes and the smell is terrible. The Manager, who is very kind, goes over to those men and gives them a severe tongue lashing. I am very embarrassed. Then he seats us at another table. I have the impression that Maria and Adam are also in the hotel, but I'm not worried about them. I suggest to the Manager that he send a female staff person into the ladies' washroom to search for Mary. He thinks that's an excellent idea, and also suggests that we look elsewhere for her by ourselves. The manager then leads me on a long search for Mary. We go through a tunnel under the hotel and out into the street. He leads me to an address where he was sure we will find Mary. But when we get to this address, I discover that it is a small ladies' wear store. It is managed by 2 or 3 older women. They know nothing of Mary's whereabouts and are quite cool and indifferent to our inquiries. They just want us to leave them alone and go away. So we start to search again for Mary. The dream ends here. During our walk through the tunnel, somehow I received a phone call, or communication, from a woman (who is not Mary). She may be the woman sent by the manager to look for Mary in the ladies' washroom. Perhaps she is reporting to me on what she found. This woman is laughing and joking and I am amused. But I have the impression that I don't know what she's talking about because I can't hear her voice clearly. Also water is dripping on us in this part of the tunnel which is very narrow. It is barely wide enough through which to move.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary is washing herself at the (kitchen?) sink. She is stripped to the waist. To her immediate right is a large window. It is open. It is not covered by a blind or drape. Mary is clearly visible to anyone outside. Mary is happy and looks healthy. I am standing behind Mary, and to her left. I cannot see her face. My view, from behind her, covers the area from her head to just below her buttocks. Mary comments on how much she is enjoying this wash. She tells me that it's been a long time since she's been able to give herself such a thorough wash -- she'd only given herself fast washes. Then Mary goes on to say that she is seriously thinking of having another baby. I am in a reflective mood. I say nothing to her, but I am very concerned that she wants to have another baby. I know that she is sick and cannot have a baby. But I am reluctant (afraid?) to say anything about her illness, so I just let her talk on. She is very happy. I am playing with an eyeglass case (holder) while she is washing and talking. I am vaguely aware that her nakedness can be seen by anyone outside, but this doesn't concern me so much as her illness does. I am worried that she does not seem to be aware that she is sick. But I know she is. How am I to communicate this to her? Shall I even dare?]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are having an argument and two children are witnessing it. These children are ours, but neither is Maria, Robert or Adam. In the dream I recognize them as ours. The argument is about Mary's decision to leave me. She tells me she is going to leave me because I don't love her. Her proof of this is that I don't have sex with her often enough. I am flabbergasted. I believe that our lack of frequent sex is her fault. While I have a great deal I want to say to her about this, I just can't get anything out of my mouth. I want to ask her why she always falls asleep ion the sofa, night after night. This prevents me from having sex if she's not beside me in bed. I also wanted to remind her of how very emphatic she was about not wanting sex when we had vacationed in the Bahamas. I'll never forget her comment: "Ed, I didn't come on holiday to have sex." I also wanted to remind her that she is ill and having sex is next to impossible. But somehow I am not able to say any of these things. I seem to be babbling. All I can do is plead with her to stay with me. I insist that I do love her. But Mary is firm in her statement that she plans to leave me. At one point in our heated discussion, one or both of us, are momentarily concerned that the children are witnessing our argument. But we quickly decide that they are going to know about our problems eventually, so they might as well learn at first hand what it's all about. Then Mary left the room. Either she says, or I know, I must look after the children and read them a story. I'm not sure of the sex of the children. I think the oldest child is a boy of 4 or 5 years, and the youngest, a girl of 2 or 3 years. I read the children a story, but can't concentrate. I have so many things on my mind. These are my problems with Mary, and my problems at work. My job suddenly demanded of me increased responsibilities -- so much so that now I must bring work home. These new responsibilities may mean more money and success at work, but I am not sure. I feel overwhelmed with my domestic and job problems. I also feel sorry for the children, but don't know how to handle them. They are so pathetic and sad.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are in our bedroom. She wakes up, gets out of bed, and I think we talk about her being sick. The layout of our house seems to be like the house I grew up in as a child. But our bedroom is on the ground floor, whereas that room was a living room in my parents' home. For some reason I go into the kitchen to check on the soup which is cooking in a huge canteen on the top of the stove. I think I said something to Mary about bringing her a bowl of soup -- that it will help her. I look into the canteen and see a thick vegetable soup. Some of the vegetables are clinging to the inner side of the pot. I stir the soup so vigorously that all of its thickness disappears and it becomes a clear broth.]]></report>

My grief is so intense that I lose consciousness. When I come to, there are other people in the room trying to comfort me. I don't recognize any of them except one person -- my daughter, Maria. They are telling me that it's OK to cry, and they're urging me to tell them what is troubling me, although they all know I am grieving for Mary. I am angry. While I don't recall the exact words of my angry outburst, the basic content of my diatribe is: "I have to lose consciousness from my grief over losing Mary before anyone pays any attention to me and my suffering." I believe they protest and try to assure me that they are always there, that they had always been available to listen to me and comfort me. I don't think I believe any of them.]]></report>

When I see how upset she is, I gather her into my arms to comfort her. I ask her if the rusty water had ruined her laundry. She tells me that that is not the cause of her upset. Her laundry is OK.

She is talking about her illness and how she is certain it has been beaten, and with her attitude of determination and confidence, she is positive there will be no recurrence and that she will remain well and live for a long, long time. My arms are around her and we are facing each other. I'm thrilled with how well she is and with her attitude. We confess our love for each other. I tell her I'm sorry that I haven't said to her, for such a long time, "I love you." Mary also expresses regret that she hasn't told me that she loves me for a long time because she's been preoccupied with her illness. But now that she is well, there is no reason for us not to tell each other of our love for one another very frequently.]]></report>

She looks like the Mary I knew before she became terminally ill. Mary is happy and active, and we are so very happy to be together. A child is with us  - a young child  - not a baby -- someone maybe 10 years old. I don't know whether this child is a boy or girl, or whether this child is Maria, Robert, or Adam. Yet it seems as though this is our child. Mary and I are very busy. But I don't know with what. Sometimes we are indoors, and sometimes we are outdoors. In the early part of the dream, Mary and I are hugging and kissing. When we disengage, I get a full view of Mary -- her face and her entire body. She is laughing. We are going through the house, room by room, but I don't know why we are doing this. We are on the lawn, in front of our house. Mary and I are very busy looking for something .A couple of older women walk by. One of them says she can't see Mary because Mary is dead. I answer her, saying that she may be dead, but I can certainly see her. The child also knows Mary is dead, but can see her as do I.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[It is winter with a deep snow on the ground. A large group of people and I are coming out of a place of worship where we had a memorial service for Mary. Just before the service ended, I realize that I had not arrange for refreshments for the people I had invited to attend the service. Then I heard someone say (or said to myself) that the refreshments don't matter -- the most important thing is the memorial service itself. If I'd forgotten to arrange for refreshments after service, I'd be forgiven. We left to go to the cemetery, which is located right behind where we had gathered. There were many people milling around, but only I went to Mary's grave. I have difficulty finding the grave under the heavy snowfall. I have a shovel and use it to clear the snow from off a plot which I believe is where Mary is buried. There are no headstones on the graves. As I am shoveling the snow, trying to locate Mary's grave, I realize that I'd forgotten the words  to any memorial prayers. I decide to just say what is in my heart. I burst out crying and talk directly to Mary through my tears, telling her how much I miss her, how much I love her, that I will never stop loving her and missing her.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are in the kitchen. Mary is working on something in the blender. The phone rings and I answer it. The phone is on the same wall as the table holding the blender. But there is a partition between the phone and table. When I answer the phone, I can't see Mary because she is hidden by the partition. The blender is making so much noise that I can barely hear the person on the other end of the line. I call out to Mary, asking her to turn off the blender. There is no response. I call again, and still no response. So I look behind the partition. Mary is kneeling on a chair. Her head is down and it is pressed against the wall. For a split second I think that she is unusually concentrated on her work with the blender. But in a flash I realize something is terribly wrong. I tell whoever is on the phone that I have an emergency and can't talk, and hang up. I go to Mary and take her in my arms. She had fainted, and the wall is soaking wet where her head had struck it when she had lost consciousness. I can't tell whether it is blood or sweat. Mary's eyes are fluttering, although she is out cold. She is moaning slightly. I call 911 for an ambulance. The dream ends where I am cradling Mary in my arms. I don't know whether we are in the kitchen awaiting the arrival of the ambulance, or are in the ambulance on our way to the hospital. In this dream Mary appeared as she had before taking ill. There was no indication that the illness was wasting away her body.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I and some other people are in what appears to be a restaurant. I don't know these other people, and it seems we are in a South American country. Mary is dressed in an evening gown which is low cut, leaving her shoulders bare. I don't like the gown's style or color, but make no comment. Mary is very unhappy and I am most concerned about this. We both know she is ill. I suggest we leave the restaurant and go to a movie to get her mind off her sorrows. We go to where the movie theater is located. It is a very miserable place. It is in one of several one-story buildings which are made of corrugated iron. They are painted either gray or a very dull green. There are no doors or windows, so we can't find the entrance to the movie house. We wander around the outside looking for an entranceway. The place is completely deserted and no light comes from any of the buildings. There are tables in front of some of the buildings. On these tables we see empty glasses -- or partly empty glasses. It is as though people had been drinking wine before the movie began, then placed their glasses on the tables before entering the building. At one point in this dream I am cutting what appears to be coupons from a sheet of cardboard, all the while talking to Mary. I am trying to distract her from her sadness. I am not sure what I say to her, but think it was to the effect that there are other people in the world -- especially children -- who also have bad, or more serious problems.]]></report>

She recognizes the pressures under which I am living. I cannot believe that with all of her suffering, she is concerned about me and my feelings. This is so much like Mary -- to put aside her own pain and suffering and to think of others. Her concern for me -- when she has a life-threatening disease -- just broke me up.

			<report><![CDATA[I have just entered a building. It is cold and snowing outdoors. When I come indoors, a man takes my overshoes and says that he has prepared a surprise for me. I take a seat, then realize that I had had a dream of Mary. I want to record it, but my recording book is next door. I ask a girl to get it for me. She does so willingly, but only after she leaves do I realize that the weather is bad outdoors. When she returns with my notebook, I apologize for sending her outside not properly dressed for the bad weather. She says it's OK and tells me not to feel badly about this. When I take the notebook, I have trouble finding a blank page upon which to write. Someone asks me what I am doing and I reply that I'm keeping a record of my dreams of Mary. It seems I want everyone to know that I'm keeping such a record. Someone else asks me if I have to keep this record for my therapist. I answer that I am not seeing a therapist, that I am doing this for myself. As I write in my notebook (I must have found a blank page) I want everyone to see what I am writing. The book is open on my lap. I can't remember the number and date of the dream. This is because I don't have my regular recording notebook. I decide to go ahead and record the dream and to put in the number and date later, when I find my Dream Notebook. When I finally decide to start recording the dream, I can't remember what it was about. There are many people in this house or building. Everybody knows me, but I don't know them. The man who had taken my overshoes when I entered was very specific in asking for them. When he said he had a surprise for me, I assumed that it would be something to eat. And when I had asked for the return of my overshoes so that I could go get my notebook, the girl volunteered to go so that I would not have to go out into that bad weather. Yet I let her go outdoors not properly dressed for the nasty weather. She was very friendly and eager to be helpful.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[There are two scenes in this dream. In the first scene, Mary and I and two other people are sitting at a picnic table, just to the south side of the Sunnyside Boardwalk. We can see the lake in the near distance on our left side. It is dusk. Mary is happy and talking animatedly. I cannot see her face, only the back of her. Although in the dream I am sitting to the immediate left of Mary, "I" am also behind Mary, and myself, and those other 2 people, viewing everything from that angle. Mary is full of fun, laughing and joking. Two sailors are walking along the Boardwalk, coming toward us. Suddenly, Mary laughs, pulls off her jersey and bra, and "flashes" her bare breasts at the sailors. I quickly drape Mary to hide her breasts. The sailors don't appear to have noticed Mary's action, and continue their walk along the Boardwalk, still moving toward us. For some reason I'm afraid that the sailors may attack us. So with one arm around Mary and with the other arm free, I look about for a weapon or some means of protection of defense. I see on the picnic table objects that look like large platters made of a strong, shell-like material. I take hold of one of them with my free hand, intending to use it aggressively should the sailors attack us. They don't. They continue their walk and pass us by. In the second scene Mary and I are walking along what appears to be a country lane, or a poorly maintained, narrow street in the poorer part of a town. Mary is on my right side, and we are holding hands. As in scene 1, "I" am behind Mary and myself, watching the couple stroll down that lane/ street. They are sad and are crying. I am reminiscing on my life. I say that I'm only 22 years old and have already had a very hard life. Then I realize that Mary has had a much harder life than I. I turn to her and ask her to talk about her hardships. I am not sure whether I'm 22 or 71 years of age, but I make calculations in my mind and somehow arrive at the number "22." I remember saying something like, "Life is a long, or a short, ride with very few stops for fun and pleasure. Such stops are very short, very few, and far between. And mostly the ride is shit.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I have just purchased a large quantity of meat. There is so much that it fills a pillow case. I shove the meat-filled pillow case into the freezer compartment of my frigidaire. It is so large a quantity that I had to force it into the freezer and had trouble closing the freezer door. The phone rings and I answer it. While I'm on the phone, I can see two older women at the other end of the line. They begin the conversation by asking me to guess who they are. I am irritated by this, but remain polite and tell them I don't know. They identify themselves as aunts, or relatives, of Mary. I still don't recognize them. The women then tell me that the purpose of their call is to tell me to quit "harping" on Mary's illness -- to quit talking to her about illness. I am very puzzled by their remarks because in this dream I don't know whether Mary is dead or alive.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are in a large building that seems to be a hospital. Mary is confined to bed and undergoing tests. She calls me into her room and sadly, tearfully, tells me the test results are positive -- that the disease/ cancer has returned -- or was not destroyed by her treatment. Both of us cry and cry with sorrow and disappointment. There are other people in the dream, and other things are happening, but I can't remember any of these details. In my sorrow and anger I am provoked into trying to do something about this, but I don't know what I am trying to do -- am able to do -- other than cry and yell. Mary asks me why I am dressed so nicely. She seems annoyed by this, but I'm not sure what her annoyance with me is all about. I think I try to explain why I am dressed so well, and I think Mary is angry that she is ill and I am dressed up.]]></report>

Then we return to a place that looks like a floral shop. We place our bouquets in pots of water, then go looking for Mary.  I find Mary standing on the street talking to her sister Nancy. We present her with the flowers by bringing her over to the place where we have put them in vases or pots of water. Mary is so delighted with the gift of flowers that she starts to dance. It is a funny dance. She jumps up and kicks her legs out from side to side. Her dance is like a combination of a reel and a specialty Country Western dance. As she dances, I say, very happily, "That's like my old Mary." Mary is wearing an evening gown. [It is the one with white polka dots on a gray background, purchased especially for a wedding or Bar Mitzvah that we had attended many years before she died.] After finishing her dance, Mary gives me the bouquet that she had held while dancing. She asks me to put it back in the vase because she has to go to the bathroom, telling me she will return shortly.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in bed with Mary, lying on top of her. I am making love, or trying to make love, to her. But Mary is uncomfortable and unhappy and finally tells me to stop -- that she is uncomfortable, and what I am doing is bothering her. I stop. But I'm unhappy and we have an argument. I am mad at her because she had allowed me to start and to continue making love to her even though she was uncomfortable and not enjoying it. I would prefer that she tell me immediately when she's not comfortable rather than let me continue while she's not a willing participant in the act of lovemaking. The next scene is outdoors. We are shopping, for what I don't know. It is a foggy night. I am walking ahead of Mary and she is quite some distance behind me. I know I should be with her -- at her side. I don't know if I am annoyed at myself for walking so far ahead of Mary, or annoyed with Mary for walking so far behind me. It is not just annoyance I'm feeling. There is in me, also, an element of fear or apprehension for Mary's safety. I turn a corner to avoid being hit by a car. Then I enter what appears to be a store. I think I had to go down a flight of stairs to get into the store. That's all I remember.]]></report>

I am a bit late and hurrying to get things done. The layout of my apartment is odd. It's OK in the dream, but after I woke up I realize the apartment had a strange layout, i.e., I had to go out into the apartment hallway in order to get to another room in my apartment unit. When I go into the hallway, on my way to another room, Mary gets off the elevator. Mary is wearing a yellow sweater and black stretch pants. The sweater does not flatter her -- it makes her appear pale. But I'm delighted to see her. I'm joyfully surprised because she is not one of the guests that I'm expecting. I rush over to her, embrace and kiss her. But she is aloof. I ask her if she isn't going to kiss me. She tells me if that's what I want, then she'll kiss me. I become annoyed and testy and say that if I have to ask her to kiss me, it's not worth it. Then I see that she is holding Adam in her arms. He is about 4 or 5 years old and has just awakened from a sleep.]]></report>

I sit up in bed. Mary also sits up. This is when I recall getting a full frontal view of Mary, from head to waist. It is as though I am watching this scene from above, and from the foot of the bed. I don't know what prompted me to stop lovemaking. When I wanted to resume, Mary was reluctant to do so.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The TV star Jerry Seinfeld insists that I take him to a place that had formerly been a famous Vaudeville theater. I didn't want to, but he persuaded me to do so. Somehow Mary gets into this situation, because she wants to come along. The reason Jerry wants me to take him is because I have a car and he doesn't. I drive to an ugly, barn-like structure. As soon as we enter this building, Mary and Jerry disappear. They go through a doorway directly opposite the door we use to enter the building. I follow them through the same door, but can't find them. There are no other people inside this building. I want to find someone who might help me find Mary and Jerry, but there is no one to be found. Since I can't find anyone to help me, I decide to go outside and wait for them. I am bored because I have nothing to do, and angry at Mary and Jerry for deserting me. When I get outside, I notice an empty lot next to the Vaudeville building from which I had just emerged. There is a huge pile of sand on this vacant lot. I decide to investigate, go over to the lot, and walk onto the sand pile. When I do so, the sand caves in under me, and I begin to sink. I'm terrified. I call aloud for help. I see many, many people in front of the Vaudeville theater. None are looking in my direction, except one man. He is looking directly at me. I call out to him, telling him I'm in serious trouble. I desperately plead with him to pull me out of the sand. I see myself sinking deeper into this quagmire. But that man just looks at me, does not acknowledge my plea for help. He doesn't answer me. He does nothing. The scene changes. I am at home with Mary and we are in the kitchen. I debate with myself whether or not to talk to her about what had happened earlier -- about my anger at her and Jerry for deserting me -- about my fall into the sand. I think I hesitated to talk to Mary about these things because I know she isn't well. But finally I decide to discuss this with her. I tell her how angry I was when she and Jerry left me alone, how fearful I was when I'd fallen into the quicksand and no one would help me. I don't remember if Mary answered me. I think she looks at me in surprise.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are making love, but I am impotent and reluctant to make love because I am afraid I won't be able to get an erection. On the other hand, Mary wants to help me, but she's reluctant to engage in intercourse because it is painful for her. I don't know why this will hurt her because there is nothing about her being ill in this dream. Also Mary is in a hurry to go somewhere and is reluctant to take the time to have sex because it will delay her departure. At the same time, she doesn't want to disappoint me, so we do have sex. I get an erection but lose it as soon as I penetrate Mary. As I struggle to get an erection again, I am hurting Mary. We stop making love. Each tries to assure the other that it was OK, but maybe next time will be better.]]></report>

There is a golden glow radiating from and surrounding Mary. She looks terrific as we greet each other, embrace and kiss. Prior to our meeting I am looking for Mary in a house which has very small rooms and doors. I go into a room which I had already entered before. But when I return to it again, I find a small wooden box with some sort of earrings/ trinket inside it. When I see this, I know it belongs to Mary and that she must be somewhere nearby and I will find her. I leave this room to continue my search for Mary. Yet again, I return to this room where, now, I find Mary. It is here that we embrace each other joyfully. I don't remember much else about that particular room. The houses are either located in Japan or are of Japanese style.]]></report>

I am very enthralled by the grand, elegant buildings on the left side of the boulevard. They extend along that side as far as I can see. I am most impressed with their grandeur. At one point I think I see, on a distant roof ahead of us, someone on that roof. But upon closer examination, it is not a person but a statue. On the building closest to us, I can see many statues and busts ringing the walls of that building. I am very delighted with these buildings, and I tell Mary how wonderful they are, compared to the terrible "square boxes" that are being built nowadays. When I begin to talk to Mary, I look in her direction. She looks terribly weary and seems barely able to walk. She is wearing a print (grayish) dress. I immediately go over to her, gather her in my arms, and ask, "You're tired, aren't you, Honey?" She answer, "Yes, Ed, I'm very tired."]]></report>

In this part of the dream, I believe there is a fire -- or fires -- and that one, or several, buildings are burning. We return from shopping and enter a large room where a lot of things seem to be going on. Also there are other people in this room. I see a little girl and call her over. It is Maria. She's about 2 years old. I kneel down and cradle her in my arms. I hug and kiss her, and tell her I love her. She tells me she loves me, and asks if I'm her daddy. Then she starts telling me "things" that she's picked up from watching "soap operas" on TV. She is very cute and charming. Suddenly I see Mary, who is busy moving about and doing things. I manage to catch her attention and tell her of all the cute things that Maria had said. Mary snaps at me, and asks, "Why are you concerned?" I tell her, "I'm not concerned about anything. I'm just trying to share with you the cute things Maria said." In this room I suddenly discover small fires burning on tables and on low cabinets. It appears as though a jar of peanuts had exploded, which resulted in small fires breaking out there and there throughout the room. I pick up one of the peanuts (from one of the fires) and taste it. Some man -- he looks like a black man -- chides me for doing this. I see a glass (it looks like a  tall sherbet glass) standing on a counter or table top. I pick it up and pour water into it from a glass jar that I have in my other hand. I want a drink of water because I'm thirsty. Mary appears, and takes the glass of water from me.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary phones me. This entire dream shows me talking on the phone to Mary. At first we exchange pleasantries, then I ask her where she is. She tells me she has a job and won't be home for a few days. Her job is in a small store and she must descend a steep stairwell or pit and get some bottles and bring them upstairs. Apparently this job is very particular and not anyone can do it. Mary is filling in for the regular person who has this job. He is ill or on holiday and Mary agreed to cover for him. I can hear a man's voice in the background expressing pleasure at how well Mary is doing the job. I tell Mary I'm pleased she has a job, but express concern because it seems to have some dangers in it. I'm particularly concerned that she not injure her leg (the thin one) and share my concerns with her. Mary says she can understand my concern, but that we can talk about this later. Although I'm on the phone with her, I can see Mary (vaguely) at her place of work, and it looks terrible. She is at the bottom of a shaft and while it is not deep, the stairs are very steep. The place seems dank and dark and damp. The dream ends where Mary, laughingly, says she understands my concerns but we can talk about it later. I tell Mary that if I know her, it means we won't talk about this again, that she'll stay on the job until the regular guy returns in a day or two, when Mary will come home. Mary just laughs at my observation.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I see Mary, but not clearly. I believe she is angry at me for having had a brief sexual encounter with another woman. But that was many, many years ago (over 20 years ago) and I thought we had gotten over that long ago and there had never been another lapse on my part since then. I'm not sure what we talked about (in the dream) but Mary's mood changed from anger at me to that of being very solicitous toward me for some problem I am facing. (I have no idea what that problem is.)]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[We are in a car going somewhere. There are others in the car besides me and Mary, but I don't know them. Mary is not feeling well. She opens the window and the driver of the car orders her not to -- that open car windows bother him. Mary complies and closes the window. She fans herself. She looks awful. I remonstrate with the driver, telling him Mary isn't well and needs air. But he insists that the windows must remain closed. Mary tells me not to bother. I suggest that if she's not feeling well that we turn around and go home. Mary says not to do so -- that somehow she will be OK. I come over to her and put my arms around her and she nestles into my arms. She tells me that this is what she wants -- that I should hold her. Then she tells me I've not been fair to her. I don't understand what she is saying -- something about my not being close to her. The dream scene shifts. We are in a bank and someone hasn't got enough money. It's a very small sum that the person wants -- less than five dollars. The person informs the teller, when submitting a check, that there is not enough money in his account to cover the amount of the check. The teller gives him the money on condition he promises to repay the bank. But as soon as he gets the money, he says he's not going to make good on his promise. I get angry and take money out of my pocket -- either to give it to him or the teller. There is a bit of an altercation between me and this other man about what to do with the money. Throughout all of this Mary is standing nearby, looking on and saying nothing.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I know Mary is in this dream, although I have no clear view of her at all throughout it. We are living in a very small, cramped apartment, house, or flat -- I can't tell precisely what type of dwelling. Mary has prepared a meal for me -- it is on a large platter. It consists of lettuce and what appears to be filet of sole. But I can't find the time to eat it immediately after it is prepared for me. Some time later I find the time to eat and I look for my meal. I find it on a table or (?) in a very small room, the size of a pantry. When I see that the meal is fish and that it had been standing for some time, I choose not to eat it, fearing it might have gone bad. I take it over to the garbage (waste) container in the kitchen. It is difficult to open the lid of this container because it is wrapped up in lots of plastic (wrap?) in order to keep the place as clean as possible. Then, when I try to get something from the cutlery drawer, this too is protected with lots of plastic coverings. Somewhere in my mind I think Mary is "crazy clean." There is a brief instant where I have a conversation with Mary. I say that I think she is not happy with this place where we live. I can't remember what she answers, or if she answers me at all.]]></report>

Then I pour the hot water from the tea kettle into a mug which is on the arm of the sofa at Mary's head. The tea spills, fortunately missing Mary. I apologize profusely and grab a towel and start wiping up the mess. Mary bursts out crying and seems to be taking the blame for what happened. I tell her it's my fault and not hers. She says she's going to quit taking this course. As I question her -- what course, where and why is she taking it -- she tells me she's taking a "Bad Boy" course in which she's supposed to learn how to drive out the "Bad Boy" in her. It's very complicated and I ask more questions, trying to understand what this is all about, when the dream ends.]]></report>

I think she is wearing a robe. I place a paper or sheet of paper on her cheek and am stroking her head/cheek/forehead through this sheet of paper. There appears to be some sort of design on this paper and I'm trying to trace some kind of pattern on this paper in the hope that if I touch the right spots on the paper, and in the right sequence, that Mary's pain will go away. I am repeating over and over again, "I wish I can do something to make you better (or to make the headache go away").]]></report>

She was under the impression that at age 70 years the Government would automatically send out her Pension. She is surprised to learn from me that she would have to apply for her Pension. I said I'd help her get the application form so that she could complete it and send it in.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am in a play, or in some business venture, in which I must have an association with this woman. I don't know whether it's a play in which I must kiss her in some love scenes, or whether it's a business deal in which I must negotiate with her. At any rate, friends advise me to break it off because certain people (and they name them) will gossip to Mary about this and convince her that I'm having an affair with this other woman. I think this is ridiculous. I am not having an affair, and Mary trusts me and knows I wouldn't cheat on her. Next I'm taking a shower and it seems to me someone has come into the house. I feel a draft and get out of the shower and find the bathroom door open. I step out of the bathroom and look around. I see no one. I call out, "Mary, is that you?" There is no answer. I go back into the bathroom. There, on a table, is an empty wine glass (or cocktail glass?). When I see this, I know Mary is home. I dry myself, then search through the house, looking for her. After looking through several rooms, I find her lying on the sofa, her back toward me. I am delighted to find her, go over to the sofa, kneel down, and try to embrace her. She yells out angrily at me, "Leave me alone! Don't touch me! You're having an affair with..." (she names the woman, but I have no recollection of the name as I record this). My first reaction is to laugh and tell her this is a lot of nonsense. As I do so, I remember what my friends told me, that a certain person would gossip and plant seeds of doubt in Mary's mind about my relationship with that woman. I am in the process of trying to explain the true nature of the situation to Mary when the dream ends.]]></report>

Then, after a very long wait, I see Mary coming toward me on the opposite side of the street. She's wearing white slacks and a blue and white jersey. But the back of her jersey is undone. Mary looks worried. I go toward her and when I join her, she tells me the news is not good. She has just come from the doctors who told her about the progress of her illness. She tells me that they are honest with her and tell her what symptoms to look for. They tell her what are the good signs and what are the bad signs. A bad sign is if she gets headaches -- this means the disease is getting worse. She has a headache. I begin to cry and lay my head on her shoulder. At one point I call her "Maria" instead of Mary and I can't understand why I made such a mistake. I am talking and crying and trying to tell Mary what is in my heart. I want to tell her all about how I feel and I want her to tell me what she wants, should she die.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are seated at a (banquet?) table with many people. Mary is on my immediate right, and on my immediate left is a young boy of maybe 10 years. When I am served my plate of food, the young boy grabs my spoon to use as his own. When I turn to him and reprimand him for his behavior, Mary bawls me out, accusing me of making trouble. The scene shifts. I am in a large building -- a hotel -- but I can't find the elevator. I go over to a woman in one of the small shops in the hotel. And when I ask her where the elevator is located, she laughs and turns to another woman and tells her what I had asked for. They both think it's a good joke. Earlier in the dream I'm in some kind of job where I work on shifts and my boss or supervisor informs me of the times when I begin each shift. Although I am on time for my first shift, he seems to be taking me to task for being late for that shift. In that part of the dream where Mary is seated on my right, I can't see her clearly because I am giving my attention to the boy on my left -- but I know it is Mary. And she is certainly angry at me.]]></report>

When I found a piece of paper, it did not contain the proper prayer. As I had never memorized that prayer, I had to improvise a prayer for lighting the religious candles. We held the match together and jointly struck it and applied the flame to the candle wicks. But the flame kept going out and we had to strike several matches before we got the candles lit. Because it was awkward for the two of us holding and striking the match together, I took it upon myself to strike the match by myself and this troubled Mary, who wanted to share in the act of holding and striking the matches together with me.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I see Mary on her back lying across 2 or 3 dining room chairs, dressed in a bathing suit. The dining room is in the home of my parents (where we used to live, when I was a child). I am on my way out of the house, and as I am walking through the hall going toward the door and passing the dining room, I glance inside and see Mary. She is lying on those chairs (whose backs are against the wall and just under the window) which are on the far side of the dining room table. I come around and talk to her. I think I said that I can't sleep and she also said she can't sleep. It is when she began talking that I noticed her. I come around to her side of the table, drop on my knees in order to see her better, and talk to her. She says something funny, and I reply, "Oh, you're so adorable." Earlier in the dream, and before I see Mary, I am bothered by a long, jagged toenail on the big toe of one of my feet. I look for, and find, a place where I could cut that toenail, and did so. It took 2 cuts to shorten the toenail. It feels so much better after I do this.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I'm driving a bus or a very large touring car. Other than myself, the only others in my vehicle are a woman, sitting beside me, and a man in one of the back seats. We are on a highway going somewhere when the woman asks for a drink, or a chocolate bar -- something on which to "nosh." I have nothing in the vehicle, so I head off the highway into a city. I find myself in rush hour traffic while looking for a store when I can get something for the woman. I see a large (Kresge) store on a main thoroughfare and I turn off into a small side street. There is no parking space available for my vehicle, but I'm allowed to pull into a dead-end street and park well away from traffic. But I must keep the motor idling and someone must remain inside the vehicle while I leave it to make my purchases. I don't mind leaving the passengers inside the car/bus while I run into the store. But when I look in the back seat, the man is asleep. I tell the woman to waken him because I want him to "protect" her while I'm gone. Only after I wake up do I realize that the woman sitting beside me was Mary.]]></report>

She explains that she had had something done to her face (I can't recall what) and she wanted feedback from me as to how she looked. I say she looks fine, and indeed she does. It seems to me her face is heavily tanned -- her skin color is darker than normal. Then, next, I am searching through the house, looking for Adam. I'm standing in the doorway of a room and looking in the direction of another room -- or is it a washroom? The door of the room I'm looking at is closed. I call out, "Is that you, Adam?" and a voice answers, "I'm in here, Dad. I'm coming out." Before he comes out, I can't figure out whether the voice is that of Adam or Robert. Then Adam steps out of the room, assuring me that he's OK.]]></report>

As I move about, I see that the entire house is messy, so I start looking for the vacuum cleaner in order to vacuum the living and dining rooms. In searching for the vacuum cleaner, I enter the kitchen. There I find Mary. She is wearing a heavy coat, which she takes off and throws onto a kitchen chair, then rushes into my arms, lays her head on my shoulder as I hold her close, hug and comfort her. She's sobbing. I ask if the illness has returned. "No, it's not that," she sobs, "I've lost my treasures." Then she proceeds to tell me what has happened. Her voice is muffled because of her sobbing, and I'm asking questions, trying to draw her out and find out what is upsetting her. All I can learn is that she had, long ago, deposited or placed her treasures -- jewelry and such like -- somewhere, and this place either no longer has her articles, or is refusing to return them, or is denying ever having had them, or is asking her to present them with documentation of proof of ownership. It is very confusing. I think I see Mary as having gained weight. She is dressed in a Japanese kimono and wearing a Japanese hairstyle.]]></report>

I have the replacement pictures hidden about the room (house?) behind, or under, various pieces of furniture. I'm in a hurry because I'm expecting Mary to return at any moment and I want to surprise her with my new rearrangements. I'm sure she's going to like the changes. Adam is somewhere in the room (house) helping me. Then I go to the door, open it, and Mary is there. I'm delighted to see her. She looks older, but her hair is still very dark and she's wearing it in the upswept style. I gather her in my arms and want to kiss her, but I'm not sure how to kiss her because she's been away so long. Should it be a kind of "on the cheek" kiss, or should I give her a passionate "on the lips" kiss? I do both. First on the cheeks, then on the lips. But she pushes me away when I kiss her on the lips, and laughing, says she has a cold and doesn't want me to catch it. She's very tactful in her approach and I don't feel any resentment. I'm happy she's home. I escort her inside to show off the changes. I have to take the pictures out of hiding to show them to her and I'm happy that she's pleased with the changes I've made.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Mary and I are in what appears to be a dining room with other people. These other people seem to be family and friends. We are either in our own home, or in someone else's home, entertaining or being entertained. Mary is in a fun-loving and playful mood and is able to convey to me that she's interested in having sex -- like right now! I go along with her mood, but question how we can have sex now when we are in the company of others. She laughs and suggests that I try and find out -- and leads me out of the room and into a hallway where there are no people. Then she comes to me, we embrace and kiss. It is a long, passionate kiss. I think she reaches for my penis, but I can't get an erection. I say we can't have a "quickie" if I'm not able to get an erection. She laughs and suggests we try again, later on. Then I realize my lips are covered with Mary's lipstick, so I find a washroom where I wash it off. I'm eager to have sex with Mary as soon as possible, but am worried that I may not be able to get an erection. I wonder if the long period that has elapsed during which I've not had sex with Mary may cause this problem.]]></report>

She wants to regain her strength, then go alone on a trip to Mexico before coming back to live with me. Then she goes to live with this young couple. I think they are Mary's relatives -- cousins, or something like that. But not long after, she moves in with them, this young couple have problems and split up. Mary tries to help them. But I am so concerned for Mary's welfare that I go to her and try to help her and/or prevail upon her to return to live with me. There is a scene where Mary is running after the young woman and trying to talk her into returning to her husband. Then there is a scene where I catch up with Mary and we embrace. She is crying. I talk to her, trying to convince her to come and live with me if she can no longer live with the young couple, or anywhere else. Mary tells me she needs more time to get her strength back, and that she definitely wants to go on a trip to Mexico. The dream ends where we are embracing and talking.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[ My brother Harry invites us to visit him. He rented a place for us to stay during our visit. This place is a terrible hovel. It is small, dirty and cramped. The toilet is a "one-holer" in a very tiny room. I need to use the toilet and when I open the door, a woman is using it. I am so shocked at this primitive place that I refuse to use the toilet and want to complain to Harry about our terrible accommodations. Mary will not allow me, saying that we are guests and it would not be nice to complain. A group of us are preparing to go somewhere. There are too many people for one car so I am asked to choose the car I want to ride in. I choose Harry's car and walk with him to the parking garage. But he is walking so fast I can't keep up with him and lose  him when he enters the garage. When I get there, I have no idea where to look for him. I search for him for a short time, then decide that my best chance to find him is to wait at the Exit gate and get him when he drives out. While waiting at the exit gate, another car pulls alongside me. Inside, are my niece Rosa and two other people. I tell them what has happened and they say they will wait with me until Harry shows up. After waiting for a short time, I am told there are several exits from this garage and maybe Harry will not use this one. In this dream, I did not see Mary, but knew she was with me.]]></report>

I am in a large, open field and lie down to rest, either on a cot, or on the ground. All of the people in my group are nearby, in another large field. They promise to wait until after I have had my rest when we'd all go together to the casinos. When I awaken after resting, I'm clad only in my underwear shorts. I go to the other field only to discover that my friends are gone. I'm very upset. But some other people tell me not to worry, that my friends will return soon. This calms me down. I look into the field and see a small ditch in which Mary is sitting, or kneeling. I see her face in profile and she is smiling. She is not looking directly at me.  To get a better view of her, I kneel down beside Mary. The dream ends.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The locale of this dream is the bedroom of our Tree Frog Street apartment. This room is terribly cluttered and packed with furniture. I am trying to clean up and put the room in order. While doing so, I notice on top of the dresser some of Mary's belongings (cosmetics, etc.) in a pool of water. I start taking these off the dresser, examining each closely for any damage, and looking for another place to set them until I can wipe the water off the dresser. While I'm wiping the dresser, Adam (as a young boy of about 10 years old) is helping me clean the room. He is smiling happily and is very involved in his work. I express surprise that he is helping me, and thank him. I tell him I'm sorry I haven't thanked him often enough, and that I should acknowledge more frequently my appreciation for his help. Mary enters the room. She has just finished taking a shower and is wearing a robe. I take her in my arms and try to kiss her. But she does not want to kiss me. I accept this and take my arms from around her. I am so casual in my acceptance of her refusal to kiss me that Mary apologizes, saying she will kiss me after she has tidied up.]]></report>

Since it is not yet the anniversary of Mary's death, I am confused! I do not know whether or not it is appropriate for me to rise and pray. Both Mary and I are crying. Various members of Mary's family (I think they are her family) are around us. Some are very angry and refuse to join the prayer, or resent it being recited by the congregation. There are two groups of family members, huddled together, comforting one another. One group is behind and to the left of us. The other group is standing next to a wall.

			<report><![CDATA[We have just moved into a new house and are putting things in order. I am on the second floor, trying to hang clothes in a closet, but there are no clothes hangers. Mary is downstairs organizing things. I'm amazed at how healthy she is. She had been sick but is now OK and busily getting things done. Mary accepts my offer to help her, but I just can't seem to get started. I am confused. I don't know what to do first - to shave or to shower. I don't know where to find the items I'll need for either task. I go downstairs to see how I can help Mary. She has just taken out an enormously large loaf of bread. It is so huge it has to be cut in two to fit onto the table.  Mary, pleasantly, chides me for being so slow in getting around to help her. All I can think about is how well and healthy she looks when only yesterday she had been too sick to get out of bed or to do anything. I am delighted, surprised and happy at her return to good health. But I'm also puzzled because I can't understand how her health improved so much in so short a time. All this while, I'm trying to get organized. I want to help Mary but have great difficulty getting started. I am trying to find clothes hangers and trying to figure out how to get washed, shaved, dressed, etc.]]></report>

Mary is walking ahead of me and she's wearing a white cocktail dress. At one point I see myself touching her waist. As we walk through this room, Mary helps herself to some of the goodies laid out on the tables. As we are walking, I tell Mary that she's beautiful. Her response puzzles me. She tells me that most people who know her have gotten over that part of their relationship with her. I don't understand what she means by that. Does she mean that all I'm interested in her is her beauty? I am concerned that she's stealing candies from the tables. I don't recall in the dream whether I said anything to her about this or just thought that I should speak to her about this. I never saw Mary's face because I was walking behind her, but I know I am with Mary.]]></report>

The handwriting was barely legible but I could make out the message.  Mary had called while I was out but she would call me again at 4:00 pm. There was a phone number where she could be reached. I did not know whether to call her right away or wait until she called me at 4:00 pm. But I wanted to know who had taken the message and opened the door of my office to see if I could find the message taker. When I opened the door I was looking into a very large open-spaced office filled with very many desks. No one was there, except, several desks away and directly in front of me were Jerry Seinfeld, Elaine, and Kramer or George huddled around a desk. When I opened my door they just looked at me indifferently then went back to their discussion. I shut my door, returned to my desk and went on wondering whether to call Mary now or wait for her call. There were a number of plates and bowls in my office that more appropriately belonged in a kitchen. I woke up before deciding what to do about calling Mary.]]></report>

I rush over and greet her just as she gets to the top of the stairs. I gather her in my arms and hug her. She looks fine, and except for her heavy breathing from climbing the stairs, she is OK. I ask if she'd like a nice cup of tea and she answers that she would like that. I rush off to the kitchen to put the kettle on to boil to make the cup of tea.  When I was writing the message on the towel I make some reference to one of her brothers.]]></report>

I am preparing to marry Ali Mershman (an Indian or a Turk?) but he also is married to some one else; I go through the whole ritual; see pictures in prayer books, hear music, etc. At one point in the ceremony I see Frank who says: "I don't think you should do it, it would complicate matters." Then I decide not to go through with the marriage ceremony. Ali agrees and says he does not want to join "your sect." I want to pay the priests, but he says no. I say to the priest: "I believe it is the true Church because it made you see the Truth." I leave and kiss Ali on the mouth. Joking and relieved. See his wife; she is angry at him. "Whose ideas was this?" -- See Frank working at the RR, leaning over to drink some candy syrup - red and green, in vats, with some very vulgar guys. Walk along the stadium toward the University with Jules. I plan to write him about Ali when my watch falls out of its casing, but I find it and put it back... wake up.]]></report>

For a while it looked like cathedral was on fire too, but it was saved on time. Father Andrew is calm and he looks older and wears steel-rimmed glasses. He says You are too impetuous" We go to a restaurant and eat ice cream together. -- With Frank on a lake that is frozen we ski around on the ice; it is just barely thick enough; Frank cracks through in a shallow place and wades upstream. --At the Palmer's: reading movie column; feel removed, not part of group.]]></report>

Then somehow Frank and his friends "get lost;" later see them again in open car, laughing. I look for children in big building near the sea; they are lost, crying. I go swimming with them -- in the water, I see shimmering and reflection of sun in the water -- a metal sphere with small metal pieces... show it to Wendy; then suddenly the sun disappears and it is dark: I hear Father Andrew give a lecture in French. I go upstairs...]]></report>

She resents the children and we joke about my spending time with Don and she with Frank, but in reality we would rather be alone with our own spouses!

			<report><![CDATA[Big gathering at Church: many strangers: old men, rich people, etc. Father Andrew is preaching and there is a rebellion: people turn in their keys: throw their keys at him (like the stoning of martyrs) and they murmur against him. He is shaken and bruised, and I help him to a bed and arrange the covers, and wipe his brow, and he rallies. He thanks those who remain loyal, among them is Frank, who sits at his right in a chair and talks to him. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But only a few faithful remain, mostly women and children. He asks me to get him some pills, and hands me a big bottle with pills: finally he takes 2 blue pills; I go next door to a bathroom for 2 glasses of water; there is a big mountain of aspirins, and Reynaldo is there, he has to go to the bathroom. - Finally Father Andrew rallies and gets up and is able to give the congregation the Anditheran (bread). He asks me if he should wear a tie, since he lost his "chasuble" in the fray....]]></report>

I almost shout; he smiles and I remove my arm, but he still holds me, almost upholds me. "That is why I am in the Church, because when they see you do this--give Communion--then they really learn!"

Then Father Andrew lies down and falls asleep on our bed. He is covered with a white bedspread. Then he says before he falls asleep and while I am still busy with my children: "There are days that are seedless days." And I think of what this means? Father Andrew remains in deep peaceful sleep while I keep working.]]></report>

I pick them up and put them back on the plate. Father Andrew in civilian clothes, sitting on the floor. I sit behind him with my leg just touching his back. I am to eat outside with the children on a square table--chicken dinner--while others are making shish-kebob. We have time to walk by the sea side, see the ocean. Climb down a steep hill, then we hold hands and run as fast as we can along dunes and hills by the sea side. Perfect Joy. Other incidents: He asks about me as a young girl and wants to caress and touch me. Scene in bathroom with telephone near tub with man giving instructions on how to use phone near the tub; hear water rushing from a faucet and try to catch it.]]></report>

He sits next to Bud and me; it is early spring: view of bright blue sky and new leaves on trees. It is beautiful. But we cannot stay there; we have some car trouble in the garage: oil smell. He tilts car up. I leave and go back to lecture. Also talk to a man on my left, a priest, who listens to what I have to say about coincidences. But he still mostly laughs it off. Boat stranded on Lake Columbus and someone at church rescues it. Sara S. getting out of bed and getting dressed.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Eli comes in from the kitchen door: I embrace him and we walk around in a circle several times, like a dance. Then Eli pushes me, compulsively to the front porch of our house, it is completely free of books and has beautiful flowered wallpaper, no windows; it looks like a regular room. Eli stands at the N end against the wall with the wallpaper. A man with a muslim type shawl wound around his head comes and stands next to him; he begins to explain his faith to Eli. I step back and begin to DANCE, clicking my fingers like castanets!! I think it is rather sexy. I am aware of Eli watching me, it is exciting. Then it shifts and I drive in a car with Wendy and some older folks to an ART GALLERY. We enter and Wendy stops to talk to some women she knows. It is dark with only dim lighting. I walk into a hall down the way and it has almost exactly the same wallpaper as I saw on our front porch with Eli! I am amazed... I call to Wendy, "What a synchroncity!!"]]></report>

We kiss and he wants to make love, but it is too public and there is too little time. I go away reluctantly, but then return a while later under the pretext that I had forgotten something. He has put up an elaborate screen, made of wallpaper so that we can have more privacy. But there still is not enough time. I promise to come back later, ALONE. Later I see him dressed and he winks at me. Later at the Book Cafe I see Margaret working on some paper work; I go over and she embraces me warmly and holds me tight. She tells me how much she loves me!! I am happy but don't quite believe her. The next day I go to work and can't decide where to park my car. vivid!]]></report>

Edward and I walk about and he shows me his exquisite collection of GLASS and ART objects, some of which he made himself. We talk about Marita and I say "You did such a good job of raising her." We are very close. I feel I wronged him; and he tells me again how much he loves me. I don't want to say goodbye. The others are already on the train. Edward and I walk down the stairs to the train platform and I say: "I still have a long way to go (i.e., much healing to do)." I LOVE YOU." Then I run to catch the train. It is already MOVING but I manage to open a door, or a coach, far in the back and to walk up to where the rest of the family is sitting. I see them waving at me frantically and believe I see my FATHER's hand waving also. very emotional upon awakening...]]></report>

I see Father Andrew, with grey hair, as he approaches. I ask him, "Do you have even a few minutes before you leave?" He waves me away, as if to say "how can you ask this when we are about to board the bus?" Somehow I follow him and Nevena and Valery onto the bus. Nevena shows me all the stuff she packed to carry on the plane. Before we know it, the bus is moving and we are at the airport. I panic and then ask the bus driver how I can get back? I offer to pay.15 cents. The bus driver says: "If you are willing to sit in the aisle seat #39 in the back of the bus, you ride back free with the next party. I am intrigued by all the pedals at that seat: harmonium, pedals, air conditioning. Then the Camden's dog Buffy is brought through the aisle, and he recognizes me and jumps up playfully and snaps at my fingers. I say, "As if I'd needed more proof that I know them well." I ride back and get off at a place where a lady is sunning herself in a lounge chair. She is wearing a bright turban and shows me her dance schedule. We talk about dance and music. She shows me a dance step and says: "I used to be Frau Greenway." (My name used to be Green). I say, "I remember you."]]></report>

I tell her how glad I am to see her and kiss her hand. We walk together. She tells me she has been in New York at Art Colony run by BEVERLY (her daughter-in-law, who will be giving the keynote address at Nat'l Day of Prayer). She gives me all the info I need to go to that colony and suddenly I am in an ART STUDIO where Father Andrew is painting many small canvasses, boat scenes. He is busy painting, so I wait to tell him how good his reflections of the boat in the water are. (CF. WW painting) But before I can tell him, he climbs up a steep LADDER to a Loft to be with someone who needs help. While I wait, two young BOYS come along and start throwing the brushes around and threatening to smear Father Andrew's painting. I get so angry, I slap the boy and order him to pick up the brushes; he gets sassy so I bend down and help him pick them up. I say "You know, Father Andrew is such a saintly man, he would not have wanted me to slap your face." The boys are contrite and leave. Father Andrew comes down from the ladder and has to leave, but he promises to talk some more about the painting. (++ feeling, vivid)]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed it was next summer and that I was going to be married to my boyfriend at home. Mother advised me not to, but said she would not stand in my way. He had very little money and George, after finally convincing me not to finish school, said maybe mother was right. I had made up my mind, however, and would not hear of a postponement. The next part is after we are married. Although I did not see the ceremony, I knew it was very simple. Someone asked where we should go on our honeymoon and I can't remember where I said, but they thought it was the place in Europe named the same. I was embarrassed when I said it was not. Then I thought maybe I should have married another fellow I know who would have taken me to Europe, but I immediately dismissed this from my mind. Mother said then that the place we were going was very nice, although neither of us had previously been there. This made me feel much better. Next we were sitting in a large dining room. George was drinking a beer and I had a coke. All of a sudden it struck me that this was my wedding night and I got nervous and sort of afraid. I then asked George to order me a double shot which I never did get to drink because I woke up.]]></report>

I was afraid the stranger who had my car would shoot me or run after me, but he didn't. I yelled to the railroad man to get the license number of the car.

He said the reason he called was to tell me that a drugstore had opened up across the street from my father's store and would take away a lot of business from my father. He hung up then and I went upstairs and told the girls that I was very disgusted because Howard had called me up just to tell me that my father had competition from a drug store across the street and didn't ask me to go out.]]></report>

As I was sitting at my desk looking out the window, I noticed a pen on my desk which was situated in a dish of ink. I knew that a man was in my room and I immediately ran out of the room. I asked one of the girls (I can't remember what she looked like) to come to my room and see if anyone was in the closet. We both entered the room, whereupon she opened the closet door and shut it again. Then she said I saw a man in the closet. As we fled from the room, the closet door opened and an old man darted out. We ran down the stairs, closely followed by the old man. Suddenly the other girl stopped and extended her foot. The old man stumbled over it and fell down the stairs.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed I was sitting in a dark car when an unidentified man opened the car door and asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I can't remember what I told him. The next thing I remember is picking up a copy of the Reader's Digest and discovering a two-page article about myself. The first paragraph of the article said that in an interview with me, it was found that I had 2/10 Presbyterian blood, a Presbyterian father and was psychologically and culturally a Presbyterian. The article then went on to describe my character. I was very angry and disgusted because of the false statements the magazine had made about me and furthermore I couldn't understand where they had received their information because the unidentified man had only asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I gave the article to Dottie, a friend of mine, to read. As she read it, I complained about the inaccuracies and lies that magazines and newspapers printed and how you couldn't believe what you read.]]></report>

I asked her if she had been downstairs to the laboratory and she said she had, but became uncomfortable and had to come upstairs. I proceeded down with the group and we arranged ourselves about the table, upon which was a prepared cadaver. This was particularly vivid. I recall the type of cutting that had been done on the skull, and the abdomen had been incised with consequent exposure of the entrails.

			<report><![CDATA[I was taking care of a little boy. His mother is a good friend of our family. They lived next door in a duplex and the lady next door was having a party for her little girl. When the children came, I played with them, especially one little boy. When I went in, this little boy followed me. He said he was tired, so I put him to bed in my bed. A while later I went to look at him and he had wet his pants. I discovered that he was wearing diapers and I wanted to change them, but I couldn't find any clean ones. I asked Woody (the child I was taking care of) where his old ones might be. He didn't know, so I went and asked the lady who was giving the party. She said that she wondered where he was. I asked who he was and how old he was. She said that he was 10 years old, but he had a very poor home life. His mother hadn't wanted him so she never trained him or loved him at all. She told me then that his name was Freddy.]]></report>

Somehow we had the idea that this was where the two lakes joined. We drove beside Lake Ontario through the little town and beside a very marshy section. A little ahead of us was a hill and we supposed that Lake Erie was on the other side. We saw a bridge going over the point where we entered the town. Just as we were about to turn around the hill, my alarm rang and I was very angry. I did want to see how the two lakes joined.]]></report>

Our double room looked out on the porch roof and as I walked to the window, I had the feeling that someone was on the roof. I pulled the blind down, but a hand reached in the window and pushed it back up. A man was out on the roof grinning at me. I was angry and tried to call my father, but I couldn't. I went into his room and woke him up. I told him very incoherently what happened and he got up. I didn't want him to go in our room because he might get hurt, but he insisted. As he walked down the hall, I forced myself to wake up. I was afraid to go back to sleep because I didn't want to know what might come next.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I dreamt that I received a phone call at the dorm and it was my father telling me that I shouldn't get excited, but my mother was killed. It seems she and my father were fishing on the lake, which they never do, and some sort of electric current from the motor electrocuted her. My father and little sister didn't seem to be terribly upset about the whole thing and I just couldn't understand it because I was crying and crying and kept calling home to find out if it were really so. I can remember walking in a cemetery which seemed like Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles and again I was crying. That's about all I remember except that I kept seeing my mother's face in front of me. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt as though I had been crying all night and I felt very upset.]]></report>

I didn't know the fellas, but I was aware of a plaid shirt that a boy across the street always wears. I kept telling them not to fight, but I wasn't overly excited about the whole situation.]]></report>

I asked him if he could help me find a date for GS who was coming in for Thanksgiving weekend.

Another girl, I'm not sure who, but probably a friend in my dorm and I plotted the murder of another girl, dark hair, tall about 20. I know we had a good reason then, but I don't remember now. She murdered her. I was just the accomplice. I saw it all but didn't actually do anything. It was set in a hotel room on a lonely country road. My parents and the other girl's parents were there. They didn't suspect us, but there was a lot that was left that would incriminate us. When we checked out of the room, I told the bellboy to throw everything out that we had left, among things the black dirty hat. I guess things were getting pretty frightening and suspicious because when I awoke to find it all a dream, I was extremely relieved and could hardly believe it. Then I fell back to sleep and again began to dream again about the same thing. When I woke up the second time, I had that relieved feeling again.]]></report>

The lower left part of the wall was gone and a room that had not existed was left bare. In a straight chair was seated a naked man, his left side facing me. A naked woman was bending over him; they were in the act of intercourse. Just the two figures were visible to me and the beauty of the pose and the symphony of body movements struck me speechless. Then suddenly the figures were gone and what appeared to be the neighborhood children filed out of the room looking furtively from side to side. I was again struck, but this time by a feeling of abhorrence at the thought of children picking up sex in a manner they know is wrong.]]></report>

I was cold and uninterested in my surroundings and company. I saw a huge obstacle loom in front of us but was not moved? (C.S.H.) to warn my companion who was driving and who did not see it. There was a crash and he was struck down dead. I merely brushed his body aside and slipped under the driver's wheel and started on, oblivious of the limp body beside me.]]></report>

I was married and my husband (really my fiance) was about to come home from work. I was anxiously awaiting his arrival and flitting about from room to room. I could see every detail of the furnishings. What surprised me was that we had been living in this house with only a bedroom suite and a piano (which is mine - "a dowry") but I had saved and planned and now had carpeting and some furniture. My husband knew nothing about it and the greatest surprise for him would be when I handed him a bank book $0.00. I was anxious to see his reaction.]]></report>

She was completely happy and content, not withstanding the fact that she had just slept with him and she was now pregnant. The fellow came into the dream pictured as a martyr who will make an honest woman of her, so he gave her a set of rings that were nothing but stone or glass - big and glaring. He had no recollection of ever having intercourse with her, although he admitted that they had fallen asleep in bed. My roommate was happy that at least she had him to herself. I was surprised at her reaction and wondered how she could ever feel that he could really love her, but she was unconcerned.]]></report>

I was shelling peas, and was in an old-fashioned dress when a girlfriend of mine, Charlotte Kominsky (20) came over. She asked to borrow something (I can't remember what) and mother said, "Bridget (which was my name), go up in the attic and get it for her."

Here I was dancing in a beautiful ballroom of the type you see in movies and in a beautiful formal, with a friend of mine, Chuck Burka (25) who is a member of Reserve's chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Also present was Al Sanow (22), a boy I used to date from Case who is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. I was drinking a cocktail and walking down a long spiral staircase, and then I was having an argument with Chuck and finally went back to dance again. Then very early in the morning, my father (50) and I were in a very large and beautiful house out on the veranda by a huge swimming pool. It seemed to have been after the party, for I was talking to Dad about it. The pool belonged to Samuel Goldwyn who owns Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios in Hollywood.]]></report>

There were about four other young boys in the show with us, all unknown to me, and all about the age of 10 to 12. As a matter of fact, they all resembled each other in looks Instead of watching the movie, they were all reading comic books and were in a more or less reclining position. I was laying down on a couch and Chuck was sitting beside, me, but I don't recall what we were talking about. Then the scene shifted and I was in a school room. The room resembled the school where I attended the second and third grades - Roosevelt Elementary School in Euclid, Ohio. There were about 15-20 students, none of whom I remember. My husband, Chuck, was the professor. I was sitting in the front row to his right conversing and acting silly with the girl who sat next to me. I knew my husband was getting angry with me and would bawl me out when we got home, so when the bell rang, I rushed out of the door and didn't wait for him.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that a friend of mine, Lois Watkins (20), and I were working in physiology lab on a cadaver. We were working specifically on the stomach of this male cadaver, trying to find red beads in his kidney. I remember that we were the only ones who were unable to find the red beads, and at last our lab instructor (a young fellow, about 20-25, whom I don't know) came over to help us. He held the cadaver upright in a sitting position while we hunted. Here my dream seemed to end, or at least I don't remember any more of it. I do remember us probing around for the red beads, however, and at last we saw them, but didn't move them as other members in the class did. I also remember that we were working at the last lab table and that our cadaver was very limp and his hands, feet and face were not covered as the cadavers in medical school are. Our cadaver was a young, nice-looking (about 20), blond man and looked more as if he were just sleeping and not dead at all. I remember being a little frightened at the thought of seeing the cadaver for the first time, and then surprised at finding him looking so natural and not finding his hands, feet and face bound up. Lois and I also thought it was funny and laughed a good deal at being the only members in the class who couldn't find the red beads.]]></report>

Hanging from the ceiling were streamers which were all entangled. Upon looking around, I saw that all the men there were wearing the identical tie - it consisted of a red, white and blue design with a horrible man's face superimposed upon it. In addition, replicas of this tie covered practically every inch of the walls. Wherever I turned, I saw this very tie. I was very upset about it because I had bought this same tie for my brother that afternoon. It was without the face, however. I disliked the thought of giving him something that everyone else was wearing.]]></report>

It was an intersorority council meeting and my roommate was officiating and sat at the teacher's desk. This I couldn't understand because she isn't even a member of a sorority. I was sitting sidewards in the chair and it probably looked as if I were talking, but actually I wasn't. My roommate started to scold me for it and in front of the classroom of people. I tried to explain that I was completely innocent. She wouldn't listen to me and it turned into a mild argument. We let the matter drop and she resumed the conduction of the meeting. A short while later the girl sitting behind me began to speak to me. I listened to her intently but never uttered a word. Again my roommate scolded me for talking but didn't say a thing to this other girl. At this point, I was just furious. I tried to explain what had happened but she wouldn't believe me. She insisted that it was my fault. The result was a vehement argument, but nothing I said could change her mind.]]></report>

I had them all correct except one which she switched around to make it the right construction. Then we walked out of the classroom since she a class and so did I. As we came out into the hall, I saw a friend of mine coming out of another classroom. He looked as though he just had a biology class of some sort because he had a white coat and a pair of white trousers on. He had a bandage on his hand and half way up his arm. I asked him what had happened and he said he was playing football and had broken his wrist. I waited until he put his coat on and then we went home together.]]></report>

I had signed out for this dance before I left my dormitory that evening, but had merely done this in order to secure a later permission than what I would ordinarily receive. The girl evidently knew I hadn't gone to the dance and she was asking me all about to see if she could trip me in any way.]]></report>

(The only person living there is an old woman and a few servants.) Then the dream shifted and I imagined that a good-looking young man in a naval lieutenant's uniform was cleaning the outside of the windows of my room. He entered the room and we began talking. I remember him admiring my ring and I told him that it was a gift from my parents, etc. He told me he had tickets to see Romeo and Juliet and asked me if I would like to go. I accepted and the dream then shifted and we were saying goodbye on the porch of my dormitory. I told him I didn't even know his name so he told me what it was. It was a long name and I couldn't understand it, so he took out his billfold on which his name was stamped in gold. The first name was Avilo as near as I can remember. It doesn't mean a thing to me. I was hurt that he didn't ask me what my name was so I told him that he didn't know it. He said yes I do and he told me what it was. He was correct. I remember that in my dream I deduced from this that he was a friend of the original boy in the dream (the one who was supposed to have been pinned) and that he had told his friend to call me and ask me to go out with him.]]></report>

Nancy replied to my statement with a rather sarcastic hum which in real life torments me to some extent. I got so excited that I took her head in my hands and banged it twice against the wall. She was resisting strenuously. As I was about to do it the third time, I controlled myself and stopped. I think Nancy was laughing while she tried resisting just as if my actions were amusing with no intent to injure. I don't know whether my feelings were of wanting to hurt her or just to pretend I was disturbed.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed this dream the night before my friend Tia Sticapoulou went to New York. I dreamed I saw her walking down the street with another of my friends on the day that she was to leave. I inquired as to what had happened. She replied that she waited for a number of hours and that the person didn't come that was to take her. She was weeping bitterly. Seeing that I have no other connection with Tia other than knowing her in the dorm, I associate her with Bellflower House on Bellflower Road. However, the setting of this dream was on the street where I once lived here in Cleveland. I could see very clearly my old home with the bakery next door and the high cyclone fence around it. I even saw some of the houses and familiar faces that I once knew. Tia is a very good friend of mine who lives in the dorm. She is older than I am and is 23 years old. The girl that she was with is also a girl from the dorm who is nineteen years old. This girl, Maryanne Adams had no active part in the dream other than being with Tia.]]></report>

Someone came up to me and asked me to dance, and some time later this same individual in exactly the same manner asked me again. I can't explain how he asked me, but I do know that it was in the exact same way. The second time I said fine and grinned. I can't remember how I answered the first request. The second time he asked me was just after some sort of intermission. I recognize the person as someone from either Case or Reserve campus' but I know that I have never met him. I was very conscious of him wearing a brown checked jacket and was also aware of the dress I was wearing, but not of the color.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In my dream I was in bed aware of the fact that I was about to give birth to a baby. I fell into a deep sleep or when I woke the baby had been born. I had no pain and there was no evidence of afterbirth. At the time my parents were away and on returning both were overjoyed, especially my father (this is odd because actually my father hides his true feelings very well). I gave birth to a beautiful girl with long hair. She was very tiny, but very active. The happiness and love for my child and the baby's beauty was predominant in the dream. Then somehow my relations and I were together. I can't recall how we were united why or when. My uncle was predominant. He gave the baby some sort of a cradle or bassinet. This baby always attempted to get out of it. Everyone seemed surprised at my having a baby and I kept telling everyone I was married to Bob (Bob is the person with whom I have just broken up and whom I had planned to marry) although I had no ring. Then I remember a car but that's all. I didn't recall its significance.]]></report>

There were chairs along the wall all occupied with people who are proctors. There seemed to be more of them than students taking the exam. One girl, a student from Guilford house, was one of these proctors who had a bright blue outfit. She was sitting with her legs crossed and her head supported in her hand which in turn was resting on her knee. Another proctor had on a coat with a wide green band on the bottom and then fur. As I came in the lab, I remarked to whom I was with, that there are more people to see that we don't cheat than there are kids taking the exam.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was planning on going to a big formal dance, one of the Mather dances to which the girls invite their boyfriends. I was very worried about who to ask, and for some reason I didn't want to ask Milt. A girlfriend of mine I don't know who, got me a blind date for the affair. The night of the dance I received a pink camelia, but it was not as beautiful as I expected, so I was disappointed. I remember that it was 9 o'clock that evening, and the fellow I was going with had not come for me. I tried to call Milt because I was certain that he would go. I was unable to reach him for a long time. It seemed like I was calling him by long distance, and I was sure the operators were listening to us, when I finally got to talk to him. He came right away, but we didn't go to the dance. I seemed to have forgotten all about it. He surprised me very much slipping a diamond ring on my finger. I had no idea that he was going to propose to me. He told me all about the house which he had almost finished building. I remembered that he had started it 6 months ago, and when I asked him why it was started to long ago, he turned his head away and looked a little bit ashamed, telling me that he had started it for some other girl. I didn't feel jealous though. We were both extremely happy, and talked for a long time making plans. The setting of the dream was not too clear. I think the last part was somewhere near my home. It was a long dream and once my whole family was there. They were all very happy for us.]]></report>

It worried me to be doing this, because I was supposed to die, and I didn't know how much gallivanting I should be doing. Somehow these activities my friends wanted me to participate in carried me to Albuquerque, N.M. though the town in my dream was nothing at all like Albuquerque. (I was there several years ago.)

In real life she is a good friend of mine, in my dream she was a good friend of mine, out of a blue sky she could do nothing but look at me with disdain; not a word passed between us. It was my birthday and I was having a small party. My teacher was there along with a few or my girlfriends. I was opening gifts and had showed the teacher one of them, but there was such a cold lack of response, I showed her no more. When it was time for my guests to leave, I thanked the teacher for coming, but her answer as again only a look of disgust. Later I remarked to my best girlfriend (the only other person whom I recognized (in my dream) that I didn't know what I had done or said, and hence couldn't understand Mis blank's behavior. The only thing I could remember was that once I had said she was rather an odd person.]]></report>

Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do. Then I was in a designer's shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was. Then I was with my cousin (f, 5) in a small room. I don't know where. I left and went outside to a parking lot where I found my parents (both 45). Then my cousin came running out and she was crying very hard because she thought she had gotten separated from me. I felt very bad for having left her. Then a friend of mine (f, 20) appeared in my newly made dress. I was disappointed because it was a dull brown whereas the original had been a beautiful orange color. I said do you get to have the dress after the wedding? She said yes.]]></report>

We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects with rifles, and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25) came in with the leader (m) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom. The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered. There was my friend and several policemen (I was just an onlooker for this portion) and they were in the process of collecting the gang together.]]></report>

Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone, which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well. Then I came out of the house (not my own home). My friend's mother (50) was waiting for me in a big blue car. The car was filled with many other people. Then I was at a party (I don't know where).]]></report>

Seats were assigned and I found my seat was on a small platform on the lower part of the vessel almost at water level. The platform was only protected from the elements by an iron railing, and the waves kept flooding the floor. When I asked why I was assigned to this seat, the ship's officer replied that I was classified a "masculine personnel" and must keep that seat during the whole voyage. The next thing I remember is talking to some other people seated at the same place and regretting I'd forgotten my knitting.

			<report><![CDATA[This dream concerns an artist friend of my husband's. He is an old friend and he and my husband have known each other since they were children. He is about 25. The dream itself is short. Only a fragment. In my dreams, I saw this friend of a fellow art student who was painting a picture. I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in Cleveland, as I knew that he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in Chicago to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked Chicago and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[This dream is merely a fragment, but it is all that I can remember. All that took place was in the home of my sister-in-law (my husband's brother's wife) who is 35. My sister-in-law and I were standing in the bathroom and were looking the room over. My sister-in-law began explaining to me the details of how she planned to have the room remodeled. In my dream it seemed as though there were definite plans there were going to be carried through immediately. All I remember seeing is the glass mirror of the medicine cabinet. In my dream, however, the mirror appeared more metallic than glass. My sister-in-law explained that she was going to have this mirror extended in a modern curved line down to the bathtub. Then I remember seeing my sister-in-law's face very vividly. I was very much impressed by her plans and just a little bit envious.]]></report>

Airplanes were roaring overhead and several soldiers in a fox hole surrounded by snow where reassuring me that these planes were not of the enemy. The enemy was a wicked old witch who was out to kill us, particularly me. I felt relieved at their reassurance. The next thing I knew, I was told the witch was pulled down into a whirlpool of snow and was killed. I looked at the ground and saw the hole thorough which she sank.]]></report>

I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and read of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid.]]></report>

In it were jars of different colored face powders, like one finds at a department store for mixing personally blended Charles of the Ritz face powder. They were violet, green, rose and several shades of peach and tan. I began to fuss around with the jars when my sister came back and placed some peach powder on a little glass lid in the center of the case. At that I offered to put it in the jar with the rest of the peach powder and did so. My sister looked at me, "What did you do that for?" She ran out and got a fork and came back and started picking pieces of potato out of the jar. "That wasn't powder I put there, that was potato salad," she told me.]]></report>

As I was going downtown I noticed that his pants legs swept the ground and his overcoat dipped way down in back. This embarrassed me. Then we went into a lobby to buy some theater tickets. This lobby was much like a small town railroad station. I was sitting on one of these wooden benches inconspicuously with many other people when this boy went up to the desk to get the tickets. As he reached under his coat to pull his wallet out of his back pocket, I saw that he had a thick corset laced over his pants. Everyone laughed. I sneaked out of this lobby and into another one. I was so embarrassed. I met another boy there who told me that he was a friend of this first boy, and the whole incident had been an initiation stunt.]]></report>

After my parents came in and spoke to me for a while, my attitude began to change. I became convinced that this lover was some sort of insect in disguise and that his intent was to injure or kill me and my family. I tried to warn my parents, but they would not believe me.

			<report><![CDATA[It was night time about 3 a.m. and the streets were deserted. I was riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. I started out from my house and followed a very definite route (which has been the same each time that I have had the dream) winding up on my own street in the end. I took particular notice of various stores and other familiar landmarks along the way and got some feeling of satisfaction out of recognizing them. It was altogether pleasurable to be riding all alone through the familiar streets at night.]]></report>

One of the cousins, actually quite young, went around looking as old as her mother who looked younger than she. There was much noise until the door opened and an auburn-haired girl walked into the room. Then there was silence.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was roaming about in a ravine which was quite similar to the one that surrounded the junior high school I once attended. I think that I actually had the feeling that it was the same one, but at the same time, it seemed to be near Reserve. Then I was in a classroom, I think a history classroom, with a teacher lecturing whom I had heard of but never met. He was about 30 years old and quite personable. At the same time that he was lecturing, the boy in back of me was approximately my own age, was brushing his hair and this seemed very natural at the time. I also remember noticing a blond girl sitting to the front and right of me who was said to be very attractive, but whose face I could not see.]]></report>

I remember thinking this rather odd as the walls were freshly painted. I went downstairs again and was surprised to see a man on the roof aiming a pistol at my husband who was asleep in bed. I screamed at him to warn him and ran into the hall. The man climbed in the window, however, and was aiming his pistol at me when I woke up.]]></report>

Finally we got out of the car to ask someone where we were. We appeared to be in a rather tough part of town, and my friend suddenly disappeared.

They looked at several of the rings, including rubies and emeralds, but the little girl was particularly pleased with small carved animals in pastel colors. When he left the store I realized that he was leaving town and I hadn't said goodbye. I ran after him in pink socks and no shoes, although it was raining. I got to the station only to discover that the train had pulled out. However, another train had just come in. My father got off it and I was very pleased to see him.]]></report>

I hurried home and there I found my mother crying beside George who seemed to be perspiring and choking. I picked up a pair of scissors and began cutting off his fur. The fur didn't come off very easily so I skinned him. He didn't seem to be getting any better so I rushed him to the hospital. There the doctor said he had only a few days to live. He said that if I had brought George right to the hospital instead of skinning, he would have gotten better. I just stood in the doctor's office and cried.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The time was about 1 o'clock on Monday, October 17 and I was hurrying down the main corridor of Mather Ad Building to get to my Shakespeare class. Halfway there I met two other girls in my Shakespeare class. We started talking about the course and about the test that we were to have the following day. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had forgotten all about the test over the weekend and I hadn't studied at all for it. When we got to the door of the classroom, I stood outside for some minutes trying to decide whether I should go in and take the test or not. I had a very lost feeling and I retraced my steps down the corridor past an old high school pal of mine. I was now headed toward the library to read over my notes before the test. While I was in the library a girl asked me if a friend I knew was in my class. I tried very hard to recognize who the friend was and where she would sit in the class. I then returned to the class after it had started and took the test.]]></report>

I kept thinking that I should get ready to go to the game, but I never quite got dressed. I then found myself at a dinner at Stouffer's Restaurant at Shaker Square. At this dinner were several of my classmates from Mather. I remember seeing an elderly woman there who was in my Spanish class. We conversed in several minutes and then I heard my mother asking me what the score of the Ohio State game was. I couldn't remember the score, but I said someone made along run. The conversation then turned to the subject of a fraternity at Shaw High School called Phacoms. We talked about how may of them were married.]]></report>

As we were playing (my opponent I cannot place) a man suddenly came in and asked for some money. He looked like a beggar or a tramp. I found a nickel in my purse and gave it to him. Apparently this was not what he had come for. He started to come toward us and while screaming, we ran out the back way and up the stairs where I used to live. He followed and I called to my mother who came out and the tramp just ran as fast as he could. I woke up so suddenly terrified by this dream.

			<report><![CDATA[I know very definitely something occurred in the beginning of this dream, but I find it impossible to remember what it was. The first thing I recall is standing with a partner in a long double line such as one is taught to do in the elementary schools when passing through the halls. The dream is extremely hazy, although I do know that everyone was clothed in a net dress of some pastel color. In front of me and down one step were my parents. My mother was clothed in a green net gown, but I failed to notice my father. Somehow I knew that this was a wedding procession with my aunt and uncle who were to be married on the lead. I took absolutely no notice of whom my own partner was. It might easily have been either male or female. I faintly recall girls in net dresses brushing past me as they went up the steps, but there was not one individual in the dream who took distinct form or personality. Neither was there any plot or action in the dream. However, as was stated before, there seems to be much in the dream that I feel was there but cannot actually remember.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Glancing into the bathroom mirror, I was horrified to see that one of my bottom front teeth had a wedge-shaped crack in it. I reached into my mouth to examine it more closely and discovered it was extremely loose. As I tugged on it, I accidentally pulled out my entire lower left jaw bone. The teeth, however, remained in perfect order inside my mouth. Calmly I washed the blood off the jaw bone, which incidentally resembled that of a parrot beak calf whose picture I had noticed the day before in my genetic book. After the bone was clean, it very definitely assumed a different color and shape. It looked as though it were now made of pale blue painted wood, half my own size, and shaped like a rod about 1 inch diameter twisted around and around in loops. Tied to it was a piece of blue satin ribbon. I remember feeling very guilty about what the dentist would say when he found out I had removed my own jaw bone. Then the thought of how angry my mother would be occurred to me. Therefore, I folded the blue jaw bone in half and hid it in my closet. I knew that the dentist would have to pull my teeth since they were not held firmly in place by the jaw bone. So once again I reached into my mouth and ripped my bottom teeth out all in one strip. Again I washed them off with water and noticed with surprise that they were filled with tarnished copper--not silver at all. I was also amazed when I discovered none of the teeth had roots, but instead were held in place by little copper plates. Again I felt very guilty. How could the dentist fit me with false teeth when I no longer had a jaw bone? Suddenly I looked once again in the mirror and found with great relief that all my teeth were back inside my mouth. I remember thinking to myself that all this was only a dream and soon I would wake up. No words can express how thankful I was when I realized in my dream that it was only a dream.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing alone in the living room of my home when suddenly I spied a tiny luminous ball floating rapidly through the air toward me. As I moved away frightened, it began to pursue me, continuing the chase for several minutes. Suddenly I was no longer afraid. Curious about the characteristics of the ball, I quickly seized it and was amazed to discover it had assumed upon close examination a very different shape. Its size had increased several times, its form had become conical, and strangest of all, it was composed of approximately 50 tongue depressors sticking out in all angles, but somehow attached at the base of the cone by tightly wound rubber bands. With a satisfied happy feeling I decided the reason this object had pursued me was due to the force caused by the tightly wound rubber bands which propelled it through space. With that the dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing in a strange bathroom watching a friend of my mother's washing her hair in the sink upon which a gray kitten was perched calmly watching the proceedings. Suddenly the cat's face contorted in a wild grimace causing the woman to become frightened. Picking up the cat, she threw it into a nearby bathtub which somehow was filled with flames. Horrified I saw the kitten's fur catch fire and the cat slowly begin to burn to death. The woman was instantly remorseful, but her main thought was to put the cat out of its misery by speeding up the burning process and beating the cat over the head. Before the animal had completely disappeared in the flames, I awoke.]]></report>

She was very friendly and I decided I liked her. She told me she was from Pittsburgh and that she didn't know anyone at the resort. She and her parents and brother had just bought a cottage and this was their first summer at the resort. She asked me to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family, which I did. Her parents were very nice and just as friendly as she. Her brother turned out to be a very nice-looking blond fellow about 22 who was a senior in college. It was a very pleasant evening and I was asked to come back. The beginning of an exciting summer.]]></report>

Throughout the dream I was more upset because of the uncertainty of the disease than the thought of dying, and I was frantically questioning different individuals for the name of my fated illness. Most of the participants of the dream were rather vague, unidentifiable figures, even the doctor. I do remember my mother's presence though, but oddly enough she was not too upset about the whole thing; she did, however, try to obtain the cause for my imminent death. Supposedly blisters would appear around my eyes shortly before the end. The whole thing seemed rather inconceivable to me even in the dream. I couldn't believe that there was anything wrong with me, but I was still very disturbed by it all.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was making a telephone call on a Sunday morning. I dialed the wrong number (I don't know whom I really intended to call) and the phone was answered by the daughter-in-law of a friend of my mother's. She (the daughter-in-law) is about 23 years old and has been married 1-1/2 years. She answered by saying, "This is Buddy's wife and it's 8:30 in the morning" in a very belligerent, cold manner. I hung up. She and I are, in real life, friendly but not good friends. It's more of a big-little sister friendship. I don't see her too often.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was walking down a street that supposedly was Euclid Avenue. The street greatly resembled Euclid Avenue, but was not exactly the same. I was near 105th I think. I was walking past some houses, and went into one. Then I was in what seemed to be a ground floor room of one of these houses. A boy I liked very much was being called on a loud speaker. (I do not know who this boy is, though he resembles someone I recently had a date with.) A woman was there also--she was his mother, I think. There were several puppies in a basket on the floor. I thought of playing with them, but I don't believe I actually did. Then the boy was there behind me, I believe. I think he said something about the dogs. Then I was walking down the street again and I think I waved goodbye, though no one was there. The entire dream is difficult to recall, as are all my dreams, especially since I've been trying to remember them.]]></report>

I do not know this woman--her face wasn't clear. I did, however, seem to know her in the dream. She was holding a baby. I called the baby by my four-year-old cousin's name (my cousin is a little boy). The baby, however, was much younger than my cousin--perhaps not even 1 year old. I hugged the baby several times. A good friend of mine was with me in the dream.]]></report>

I turned and I saw that it was a Gestapo agent. I walked back upstairs and he said he had a job for me. He set me to work in room 306 taking things out of a closet with two separate entrances (like the ones at my church and is not in 306) and piling them outside. Soon I heard dance music and turned to see the room filled with people. I looked and saw Dick, a boy in several of my classes at Reserve coming toward me. He held out his arms and I went to him and we began to dance a rumba. I could even feel myself following his steps. He held me very close.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing on the bank of a small pond in which a very small yacht was located. The water was only waist deep and a boy of 20 that belongs to the young people's group I do was running through the water toward the boat. His clothes were blue. I walked along the bank and up the gangplank into the cabin. There was a mist in front of my eyes. I said, for I knew he was in there, I bet I know something. He said, what? I said, you're all wet. He said, guess again. Then I saw him smiling, stretched out on a couch with a cocky officer's cap and a light blue turtleneck tee shirt and blue dungarees. They were dry and not the same ones he had on before. I just stood there and the dream was over. His arms were folded behind his head. I had had several dates with him and he had walked me home from several of our Sunday evening meetings.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was on an embankment by a lake with two of my girlfriends from Mather. There was a card table there and some chairs where we had eaten lunch. One of the girls was away from the table. I looked across and there was a flowing river going down the hill which looked more like a ski jump. It was so smooth and there was an edge just above the level of the lake over which the water flowed slowly. As I looked at this, I saw a tall blond young man in what looked at first like a canoe sitting straight up with a paddle floating down this river and landed on the lake. He was in a kayak (Eskimo boat). He jumped out. He was wearing dark trousers, loud socks, moccasins, and a dark shirt, and swam hard to a launch nearby letting the kayak drift. The launch was wide and gray and not like any I had ever seen.]]></report>

I was in the deep water in the swimming pool at the Tudor Arms where I have a swimming class. I was holding on to the edge. A boy I knew in second grade and met again later in junior high at a young people's group and who is 19 now and a student at Case and goes steady with a girl he met at the church we go to - was standing beside the pool and helped me out. I went down the steps to the elevator as he walked down the way to the shower room and I said I would see him downstairs. The next thing I knew I was getting in his car, a small coupe, and he put both arms around me and I leaned my head on his shoulder. I was tired after swimming and it felt good to be there.]]></report>

I hurriedly changed and went out to the car whose driver (my employer) had been impatiently circling the block due to lack of parking space on my street.

			<report><![CDATA[I was part of a nationality parade in downtown Cleveland. We were marching three abreast. Each national group was distinct by something they wore. One group I remember wore Philadelphia cream cheese packages in their ears. The Russian group wore on their lapels red and white flowers. I glanced at the person marching next to me (a young woman, I think). She had little black dots resembling raisins in her ears. That meant she was a Sicilian, which made me one too because I was marching with her. The sky began to get dark and it began to rain. I had to leave the parade and round up my nursery school group. I could only find 3 of them. Two were 3-1/2 year old boys and the third was the nursery director's girl, who's also in my group. I looked for the children's drivers to take them home. I was carrying one of the boys who, though in real life is quite large, felt very light. We finally met one of the drivers who took the little girl. It was very dark and raining hard by now. Since I couldn't find the 2 boys' driver, I began to look for my car, which had been parked somewhere downtown. I couldn't find that either. Finally met the nursery director. She didn't seem at all worried where her little girl was, nor cared where my car was. She got into her car and drove away.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt I was driving to a club meeting for which I am (in reality) president. I parked across the street from the house and walked in. There were many members and prospective members sitting in the living room and dining room because it was so crowded. I called the meeting to order and then most of the members got up and said they were going on the front porch where they could hear the meeting from there. I was so ashamed and insulted (because of the guests there, many whom I had personally invited) that I put my coat on, asked one of the guests if she wanted a ride home and stormed out. Only my car had disappeared. I told my friend (my age) that it was probably stolen even though I had locked it. We waited a few minutes and soon a Negro woman drove by and parked my car. Seated in the back were four little colored boys. She got out and said to me, would you please drive these boys home? I told them all to get out and asked her how she got in. She said she forced open a window. I then got in and drove away with my friend.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I had applied and was accepted in a nursery school this summer. The hours were from 12:15 (noon) to 1:30 only. The teacher I was to assist is in real life my assistant, f, 25, in a nursery school. I was very worried as to how I could work at both nursery schools in one day. I remember taking the children in for a swim. It was a lake off a sandy beach. Then this head teacher said we would take them for a nature hike in the woods. I remember I only had on tennis shoes and therefore couldn't go with them. I rationalized that I would stub my toes with these thin tennis shoes. Therefore I stayed to prepare art work for the children because I knew the head teacher wasn't capable of it. As I was doing my art work (making balloons for them to color) 2 or 3 girlfriends appeared and we began to play cards. In the midst, my mother-in-law called to ask if we were having fun. I knew she was really calling to see if her son (my husband) was home safely. Next, I was getting my coat to leave the nursery school and I met a girl I grew up with but haven't seen in a few years. I introduced her to my husband and asked about her baby. She said it was a girl called Tonia.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was returning to a former nursery school I once worked in, as a teacher again. Only the children who were assembled as a class, I recognized as the children I have in my present nursery job. It was a period following a long vacation and I couldn't get the children's attention. I began a story and the next thing I knew the children were running all around a large grassy playground. Then I would chase them together again and try to begin the story. Next I was at a rehearsal of the Cleveland Symphony. I was there to conduct the orchestra in Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Szell, the conductor, showed me the score and then he left. The first page of the score was words only, no music, and I was perplexed. I turned the page, lifted up my right arm and began to conduct. It sounded terrible, as the players, who said they knew it so well, played without music. I had to stop several times and once I reprimanded the piccolo player for not coming in on time. Szell returned and yelled at some of the players. The players told me secretly when he left that they were playing poorly because they didn't like Szell. Leaving in defeat, my husband begins to conduct and do a good job. I woke up and remembered part of the melody of that 5th Symphony. I heard the entire symphony in my dream.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was living on a third floor suite of an apartment with my husband. A family of three ITALIANS lived on the street floor. I remembered that they were to be feared as they always carried knives. The dream skips around and I am next across the street from the apartment in a park and the three Italians are throwing (from their apartment) knives at me, only when they land on the grass and when I go to pick them up, they become darts. One of the thrown knives becomes a shining long saber knife. I believe the Italians were all males. The older one, the father, the other two, his two sons (or perhaps one was a daughter, can't remember).]]></report>

At the hotel I was surprised to find that my partner (33-year-old male) had a three-room suite while I had only one room which I did not see. I was admiring his suite which seemed to be furnished in old-fashioned taste (like his home really) and was inspecting the things that belonged to him (as I have done in his home). After a while we began to wrestle playfully and I kept wishing it would turn into love-making (as I often wish actually), but it didn't (it never does in real life either).]]></report>

She seemed to have on two because I could not see any of her body when she stepped out of the first one-and they were light green in color. We seemed to be getting ready to go somewhere together. My French teacher looked at me and said that I had better take off my sweater which I was wearing over my dress or I would be too warm. I replied in French "J'ai peu d'avon froid, je vain garden mon chandail," which is translated, "I am afraid I will be cold, I'm going to keep the sweater on." The dream ended there.]]></report>

He was watching me while I tried to make up my mind whether to take the 3 capsules which I had in my hand. I don't recall the color of the 2, but the 3rd one was a bright red capsule, and looked to me like a Seconal capsule (a strong sedative) which I know from past experience that I am very allergic to it-it makes me quite sick. After deliberating, and knowing that I shouldn't, I did swallow all 3 of the capsules, and seemed to feel extreme confidence in the man who had given them to me.]]></report>

I cannot remember the appearance or age of these people, except that I seem to think that they were about my age level. A very large man passed on the street who seemed to have a very distended abdomen. I commented on his largeness. The man I was with said his father's abdomen was like that, and that he was an alcoholic. He also said that his father was dead. Suddenly a woman started chasing us and I became frightened and ran to my car and got in and drove away. The woman seemed to be chasing me in my car. Then I seemed to be driving down the street and it was very dark and late at night. I locked the doors in my car. The street seemed to be very quiet and there were no cars or people on the street. I heard a noise and I turned my head to look out the window at my right and saw the same woman who had chased me before, running along my car and screaming. She appeared very old and her face very wrinkled. She ran faster than I was driving and began to run in front of me. I turned to the left and saw another woman (I have no memory of her appearance other than she was a woman) running in front of my car from that side. I turned the other way to avoid hitting her and crashed into a store window.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was walking out of the rear entrance of the hospital with two friends. Both are girls and one is 27 years old, and the other is 19. I was carrying a typewriter and we were going to my car, which was in the parking lot. We were walking around the lot and we couldn't find my car. Suddenly one of the girls called and said that my car was over where she was. I went over there and the two of them were in a car which was not mine. It had a New York State license on it, but it was not my car. I told them that it wasn't mine, and they got out. A teacher who I had for English in high school passed by and said that if I was looking for my car, it was on the other side of the lot. This teacher was a female and about 35 years old. I thanked her and we went over to that side of the lot and there was my car.]]></report>

I was sitting on the washing machine in my nurse's uniform smoking, and she was on her hands and knees inspecting the drain. After a few minutes my father walked into the room and I introduced him to my former instructor. He was very rude when she asked him if he would get the drain cleaned. I stood next to her and whispered to my father that he should be nicer. The instructor in this dream appeared actually as she is, and she is about 35 years of age.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that my mother had died and my entire family was gathered in our living room after the funeral. We were all upset and everyone was very unhappy, and some of the family were crying. I was very unhappy, but was not crying , and I was talking to no one. I looked across the room and saw one of my sisters crying and very upset. I walked over to her and in front of everyone announced to her that I could see no reason why she was crying and acting as though she was upset. I told her that she of all people should never cry at my mother's death since she had done nothing while my mother was alive to make her anything but miserable and unhappy. At that point I was in the center of comments from the entire family, and I began to cry. My roommate then awakened me because I was sobbing in my sleep. All the people in my dream were members of my family. My sister is 39 years old.]]></report>

A middle-aged woman, dark complexioned with black hair and wearing a print dress came into the room. She said she was his wife. I was shocked and surprised and was a little angry that he had not told me about her. I seemed to vacillate between withdrawing from the entire situation feeling maybe he's not worth it all and between sticking it out and fighting. As I felt he would be happier with me than with his wife. I felt quite uneasy, but the woman began speaking to me and she seemed very friendly. I then felt at ease and comfortable.]]></report>

Another student (girl and my friend 20 years old) was there, but came in after I did. There was also a reception for our principal (who is leaving for Israel, 50 years old). I waited for my teacher, but he didn't come. The principal (female) came, but didn't go into the auditorium where the reception was. I then saw myself standing on a little side porch with my friend (the other student) and the principal. We saw a girl in a white dress coming down the street towards us. It was a girl I know, but to my knowledge doesn't know Hebrew. Anyways, the principal remarked how hard the girl promised to work in class. I seemed anxious and worried because it was after 9 p.m. and the program hadn't started yet.]]></report>

There was a door with 4 members on it. I was supposed to get married in the room. I spoke to my dad on the phone, telling him to come to the wedding at 8:30 p.m. He told me he was wondering about if he should bring an extra tie or go home after and change his tie because he was going to see South Pacific afterwards and would get his tie stained at the wedding. He told me if I needed anything, I should ask the woman. She took me into the room off of which was a bathroom. She showed me the bathtub and handed me the soap. As I was washing, my boyfriend and my economics teacher came into the bathroom. I remember it was 8:10 and I wondered if we'd be ready on time.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that for some reason I was confined in the big brown house behind our lot. I was free to come and go as I pleased within the house, but I could not leave. The interior of the house was beautifully done in pale marble. There were no separate rooms, but it was divided into separate compartments by walls which protruded from the side walls at various angles. Straw mats were on the floor, and the large, short, fat man who kept me from leaving was always watching me. A wonderful man (the boy I am engaged to) kept coming to see me very often and begging me to come away from the place with him. I wanted to very much, but the fat man would not let us. One morning a group of school children, about 7 years old, were being led by the fat man in a tour of the building. We followed them, hiding behind the marble walls until we managed to escape. It felt so wonderful to be outside in the sunshine again.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that three other girls and myself were being held in this large building by a gangster. He had much equipment for his gang, guns, lens, etc., and we kept destroying them. He became very angry, but did not kill us. He could not let us go because we knew so much. I managed to find a way to escape and the four of us looked for a place to hide. We came to Clarence Brown's furniture store. I thought this would be an excellent place since one of the girls last names is Brown. They were having a large party at the store and we had to tell just whom we came to see. I told the girl at the desk I wanted to see Clarence Brown and she replied he's been dead since 1863. She immediately knew we did not belong at the party and the gang leader's men--all over the party began to chase us down the street. We found an old house where we stayed for a while. One of the girls became engaged. We were very happy for her, but it seemed to mean that we could stay there no longer, so the other three of us set off again to look for a place to stay.]]></report>

A very old lady whom I can't place, but seemed to know, had at the time come in and placed her hand on this girl's shoulder. How are you feeling, Pat? she asked. Pat replied that she was very tired.

A bad little girl, about 6 years old, with dark brown braids, kept running up and doing something annoying, frightening, or destructive and I spanked her. The second time I took down her pants to spank, she quickly pulled off all her clothes (turning the other cheek, I suppose) and I became ashamed at my cruelty for I could not spank her all over.

Then I thought harder and remembered I had (not a class) an exam in a peculiar kind of scientific German course in advanced grammar. Yet I had not attended class since spring vacation, nor had I studied. I needed the credits for graduation and couldn't figure out why no one had reminded me of this class which I had forgotten. I tried to cram for a few desperate moments, not knowing what to do.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was eating a late at night dinner at the home of my church choir director, along with three members of the solo quartet, Sop. Tenor and bass. I decided that my hands were dirty and wanted to wash them, but I didn't know how to excuse myself for fear they would laugh. Finally I said, "I have to wash my hands" and went to the kitchen and started to splash about loudly. Just then the bass who was upstairs called, "Oh mother," in a falsetto voice at the tenor who replied, "Do you want me to hit you in the mouth?" Then the bass came down to talk to me about what I can't remember, but his last words were something like, "Well, why don't you?"]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I remembered more of this dream than usual. It is a good example of how the scenes change. Usually all but one or two are forgotten. In this dream I came late for lunch to the cafeteria, bought steak, potatoes, peas, etc. Bill $1.05. I sat with some friends who left shortly. I was next in the chapel singing the words to a bib. Lit. theme which I held in my hand--not my own theme, the name was that of a man. Another girl played the piano. An organ student came in at 1:05 to practice. We (who?) went over to the recital hall where my singing teacher was auditioning on the violin with a quartet. Soon there was a whole orchestra and we found that we had missed the overture to Carmen. A group of singers were putting on a concert version. Saw the first act in English. Don Jose was a short blond boy who kept getting shorter, ending the scene with the words, "I walk just like my mother."]]></report>

I found it hard to convince myself that it wouldn't make any difference. I was not packed, and mother was to help by getting breakfast for me, but she didn't, and I couldn't find any clothes to take. Finally I packed my winter bathrobe and that's about all. I was to fly, a fact which has been a source of fear in other dreams, but was not too important except that I remember saying, "Everything here is finished anyway. I've started nothing new." My sister and a girlfriend were going too, but the arrangements were vague. I was to fly alone.]]></report>

I berated her, but was embarrassed because a Mather girl, whom I know slightly, was visiting my home. She began to telephone her boyfriend and at this point my brother with numerous strange boys entered the house. I then found myself talking on the phone to a Western Union operator who told me that someone had purchased a leopard suit and expensive purse for me. You wanted to know if I knew of the purchase and if I thought I ought to accept it. At this point I woke. I remained resentful toward my sister as this was the most vivid part of the dream.]]></report>

It seemed that all our rushers had pledged other sororities and we were very upset, especially over one girl. We all attempted to talk to this girl, but were berated for dirty rushing. We became more upset as our favorite girls were running in and out of the cabana with other sorority girls and we were left sitting on the hill with a few, meek little girls we had never seen before.]]></report>

I did not know the gym teacher either and they seemed unwilling to allow me to conduct a class.

I went in with them and was seated near Churchill. Proceedings began and a young man stood up to talk, but I couldn't hear him because of planes overhead. Everyone laughed at him and he was very embarrassed. I stood up to berate the members for not allowing him to talk, and they were all very surprised to see an American in their parliament. As I talked, the planes became louder and everyone decided they were being bombed and left. I remained alone.]]></report>

I do not remember getting wet, but I was struggling against the waves to get to shore. I came to a shallow place, but still had to fight my way along. I remember thinking that this was significant and I must not forget the dream. I finally got ashore. Next I think I was in some church with a friend of mine (f, 19). People kept arriving, and one was my friend's boyfriend. He brought her something, but I forgot what it was. I felt lonely so I withdrew. I was doing something in the rear of the church (writing or reading, I think) and not paying any attention to the service. I looked around (my back was to the congregation) and noticed that folding doors had cut me off from the rest so I felt relieved. Then I remember someone I knew (I don't remember who it was or the sex) came riding along a road on a bicycle. I said, "You're a long way from home." The person talked to me a while and then left.]]></report>

The order was brought in a cup with the Seven Up, and the port in the bottle, only it wasn't port. It was whiskey or something. The bottle was horizontally laid on the table, and I knew I shouldn't pick it up. Somehow the drink was spilled in the cup and I put a napkin in a saucer to soak it up. I drank it and expected my head to become dizzy, but nothing happened. On the way out, I saw two girls who I know who were drinking some beer, but whether I stayed with them I don't know.]]></report>

Soon I realized that my cheek was becoming hard and knew I had the disease and would have to be shut up. My leg also became hard in one spot. The people said that I would have to be shut up, but they would try to put me in a nice vault. I felt resigned, but didn't want to be so distorted.

Then I was riding in a car with two boys, Leonard and John, with me in between. We were riding up a street lined by 2-story buildings. The outside wall of all the top stories was colored a brilliant deep sky blue. The sun was shining. The sky turned exactly the same deep shade of blue as the buildings so that there was blue, blue, blue all over. It was so bright and lovely that I almost cried. Next I was in a new, modern apartment on the first floor up on a hill. It had big light window sand pink decorations. When I walked in, I said, "This needs just a touch of blue." Then I looked around and saw at some of the little windows, flower vases, pillows, were blue. Outside was a porch, and below was a big tennis court for all the kids to play on. My brother was down there. At the time it was getting dark at twilight and I could see tiny lights in the distance.]]></report>

Somehow, they weren't on me, they were on someone else's arm. They got a dark purple color, so I took a big, wet alcohol-soaked piece of cotton and dabbed them with it.]]></report>

When I actually got well and returned to school, in my dream, Mr. Chapman was rehearsing a play and just as I had dreamed it. We started talking and I told him about it. At one point during the rehearsals, he was demonstrating a dance with the main dancer, to show the others how to do it. She had very bright colors on and they went whirling and twisting all over the place. Somehow I was in love with Mr. Chapman and I think he was in love with me. I think he made love to me even though he was married and I cried because I was so sorry he was married. This is all very indefinite and I don't remember much.]]></report>

I'm not sure which boy it was, but it was one of two that I date now. Then another boy named Victor asked me out for Saturday. (Victor is the first boy I ever went with. We broke up several years ago, but there has been attraction on both our parts ever since. I still like him, but he goes out with a good friend of mine. Since we understand each other, he periodically comes and tells me all his troubles.) When in the dream he asked me out, I knew that I already had a date, but I said okay, I would see him Saturday. He grinned, looking as if he knew about my other date, and left.]]></report>

There was no accident or anything unusual. He just lay down on the sidewalk and expired. The second part is not much clearer. I was in a sort of drawing class. We had to copy a make variations on a girl's figure. She had a very full skirt and very padded, broad shoulders. We drew her outline on the paper by drawing around a figure of her made in chocolate. Somehow, I couldn't find my chocolate figure and had to borrow someone else's. That figure was getting melted and soft, so that as I traced around it, I got chocolate all over my finger. I thought I was copying the girl's figure front view. Suddenly I looked up and it had changed to back view. I had to erase a great deal.]]></report>

There seemed to be a series of secret passages around the camp, and I was always running from something through them. Although I knew someone was after me, I was not sure who it was, so I was never sure whom I could trust. I also had the feeling that I had to get back to town. When the phone rang, I answered it and someone asked for me. Just as I was about to speak again, one of the other girls from school answered on another extension and said that I was not there.

Somehow I seemed to keep going back and forth across the street without seeming to be detected, and thus hearing the whole plot. A man who was a gangster was going to murder his mother-in-law. The only motive for this crime seemed to be that she had bought a hat that was too small for her. This gangster later found out that I heard the plot and was going to try to catch me. There was a man at the Elysium Auto Sales who was going to help me from being caught, however. The murderer's gang had come to the building where I was in a car. When I got in the car, it seemed to be enclosed; there was another car in front of it and the wall of the building in the back. When I did try to go, I seemed to go backwards. As the car seemed to start its slow backward motion, the dream ended.]]></report>

However, I left them and was walking along Euclid Avenue alone. Just after I had passed 107th Street, I saw a police cruiser and the thought came to my mind of the safety it implied. However, soon afterwards, a man started to follow me. He seemed to walk just a step or so behind me and talk to me continually. He told me that his wife was out with a colored man, but that after she had attended a funeral, and would be home again. At first I did not seem to fear him, but as he continued to follow me, my fear grew. I was about to throw an egg at him which I realized I had in my hand (where I got it I do not know) when I woke.]]></report>

We were seated at a table with one of the guests I waited on last year. His name in my dream was Mr. Bernstein, but afterwards I remembered his name really was Mr. Saferstein. I wanted to stay in Lake Placid, but I knew I had to go back for graduation. Then I felt like crying. I looked for more people I knew and saw three friends from Montreal, who had offended my parents and therefore we do not hear from them any more (really). I wanted to talk to them very badly. Afterwards outside I saw one of my parents with them. I don't remember which parent it was. I waited for them to come up the steps to the terrace, but they got into their car and drove away. My parents then told me they were going back to Canada. I was very disturbed because I had wanted to talk to them.]]></report>

Then another fellow came up who was the chairman, I believe. He offered to take me to the laundrateria. I accepted, and we drove over. We stopped the car and sat talking. I had never met him before.

It was like a television show with lights, etc. Someone in the audience asked me where we were. There was a large flat lake near us, but desert all around otherwise. I said we were near Corpus Christi or Corpus something else, I can't remember. Then I was in a hotel going up to see the princess. When I got to her apartment, I saw a lovely light blue permanently pleated nylon negligee lying on the bed. It had a darker blue tatted edge at the bottom. I admired the gown very much.]]></report>

My mother and I had to leave early because I had to go to the dentist. When we arrived, we found that the building was being torn down.

My friend accepted my best wishes and then walked away from me; she went to her locker. I followed her. She paid no attention to me. I kept asking her questions, but her answers were short and abrupt. She left and went down a stairway; I tried to follow her, but I found I had taken the wrong stairway.]]></report>

Several of the girls had dates. I did not, but the boy with whom I had gone to the stunt night dance was sitting in the seat behind me holding hands with a woman almost twice his age, and presently we turned around and began talking to the boy with whom I had gone and the woman. We talked of generalities, such as the weather, etc. Finally the ride seemed to be over for everyone left the bus. All the while, however, I was not conscious that the bus had been moving. We went into a large building in which each sorority had its own particular room. To get to the room of the sorority I was with, we had to go through the room of another sorority which I disliked intensely. But the room was empty and we went through into our own room.]]></report>

He took a napkin and napkin ring out of the napkin stand which is at the entrance to the dining room, then he sat down at one of the tables all by himself and waited to eat. I thought this was very funny and I laughed and laughed. It was very amusing. I believe he took someone else's napkin, not mine.

The water was beautiful and quite shallow in some spots, shallow enough that you could see green grass growing up from the bottom and out through the water. I felt that I needed exercise badly and I really wanted to go swimming on account of this. It seems that Miss Andreas of the gym department and some other gym faculty were there, but I don't remember them too clearly. Well, I was quite fearful of the snakes and other water creatures that might be hovering around in the shallow water, but I went in anyway and was very glad I did because the water felt nice. I woke up then.]]></report>

It was getting dark and she said we ought to turn back, but I said, "Let's keep going. We can go over the slope and around the block and home." She asked me if I was sure I knew the road over the slope and I hesitated somewhat, and finally agreed that we should turn back. It seemed that my father (42) and my sister (15) were worried about us. They were in a tower-like structure which was beside the lake, talking through a speaker system to planes which were out looking for us. I don't know what happened to grandmother, but I went up to the tower and told them I was alright. He called in the planes and questioned me where we had been.]]></report>

It was sort of buried and was trying to get out. When it did get out, I saw that it had a membrane or piece of skin attached to it, that it was not quite normal. I was wondering what to do to make it healthier when all of a sudden the duck seemed to have turned into a cake and I was cutting the cake. I was going to taste the cake and quite eagerly cut into it, when I saw right in the middle of the cake a horrible black worm with two feelers or type of sense organ-like whiskers twitching up and down. It was so horrible I could hardly look and dreamt I felt ill. Then I woke up.]]></report>

However, before I could go, for some reason I had to go see our family doctor (about 48, male). I went up to his office and sat in the waiting room while he was finishing with the person ahead of me. Finally I went in and right away I sensed that he was dead drunk. He acted very queerly, demanded what I was there for. I told him I had to be examined so I could go to the dance. I was somewhat afraid of him. I remember there were cupboards in his office with all kinds of bottles on them. He examined me very quickly. I don't remember the details of the examination, but I knew it was very short. I left his office very puzzled.]]></report>

When the show was over, the man I was waiting for came over to the last aisle in the back where I was sitting, and we started out. Then the girl came out too and I congratulated her on her exquisite performance. She looked less happy than she had on the stage, and I felt guilty about that because I was going out with my friend and she was not. There was a bench in back of us and on it was a cake that had been made for her. I think I made it, but I'm not certain.]]></report>

Everyone was laughing and talking and suddenly, but without any noise or disturbance, the car stopped. I saw that there was a white snow-covered obstacle obstructing the passageway. Someone said it was a truck. I looked to find out and it was. Some of the boys got out and only two others and I remained in the car. I was alone I in the back seat. I propped my elbows on the back of the front seat and asked my friend, thinking my date was out of the car, "Say, Pat, what's my date's name anyway? Don't tell him I didn't know, but I was never introduced." Pat laughed and said, "He's sitting right in front of you, ask him yourself." I thought this was pretty funny and made some remark I can't remember. Suddenly the boy turned around and all I could think was I've never seen him before in my life. And the next thing I knew, someone said the truck was gone and the car was full of people again and we went away.]]></report>

I asked him who he was and his answer was "a Cleveland Indian" and I was impressed. Then a crowd of the dorm kids came in and I told them, and they smiled and said he wasn't. He carried an aluminum rod which I supposed to be a bat. Then he leaped out of the window onto a tremendous ball field and suddenly there were hundreds and hundreds of people and they were all stampeding somewhere, while many others were playing baseball. I laughed because suddenly I saw that the Cleveland Indian wasn't one at all and he laughed too. I don't know why. He was medium height with black hair and very brown eyes. I know I'd seen him before. The people were running, very happily--it was some sort of a game. It bewildered me, but didn't too much faze me.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was coming off desk duty at 1 a.m. I picked up my books in the dark and started to come upstairs to bed because I was exhausted. When I arrived at the bottom of the stairs, my legs gave way and I slid to the floor. All I could think was how silly. Now I just want to lie here and sleep till morning, but people don't do that. Then a fire door opened and there were kids from the house peeking at me through a crack in it. They said, "Did she faint?" But I couldn't answer because I was just too tired to bother. Then I was coming out of the drugged state and started to laugh because I was still at the foot of the stairs and not in bed.]]></report>

The next day I was going to a party and found that I had contacted the disease took and was quite worried because I didn't want to bear the pain and lose the eye. My friends took very good care of me. One bandaged my eye while the others waited in the car for me. I was sorry to keep them waiting so long, but they said that was perfectly all right. We rode to a beautiful village and it was night time when we arrived there. Everyone was very hungry, so we stopped at a strange little place for food. I felt wonderful again and more reassured about my eye, which though it was still painful and inflamed, seemed to me to be healing. After eating, we played hide and seek, and then had to go on. I didn't recognize many of my friends, but I knew I liked them all, everyone was in a good humor and laughing and joking.]]></report>

It seemed to be an eye tooth, but resembled a three-legged individual salt dish. I remarked upon the oddity to my friends only to feel a sudden avalanche of falling teeth. My mouth was completely filled with teeth and they hurt my mouth. Again I spit the mouthful into my hand. Yet the minute they began dropping, other teeth came half way into my gums. A second time all my teeth dropped out, but again they seemed to be forced out by new teeth growing in. I thought in the dream that this was ridiculous because no one can have two sets of adult teeth grow in.]]></report>

The girl is not one of my best friends and is not married. Her baby was darling, but it was only a few months old, but was the size of an infant of 2 or 3 years. I wanted to hold the baby, so she gave it to me, but held onto it since it was so heavy. The baby kissed my cheek and I turned to my bedroom door where a high school teacher, a man about 45, was standing. I went over to him and asked him if he wanted to hold the baby.

He kissed me and begged me to break the engagement. I kept refusing, each time less sure of my reaction. I thought I was in love with him, but yet I wasn't certain enough to break the engagement.

We sat down in the living room and he told me he was going to introduce me to a girl he used to go with. I did not resent this in the least and was quite anxious to meet the girl. I remember that he called her by a Japanese name Ishihara. He called her by name and to my great surprise a tall girl entered whom I recognized as a girl who at the present time lives in my dorm. I didn't let either of them think that I knew who the girl really was--felt shocked and hurt. Next day I saw the same girl at her home (in the living room) and asked her if she had previously gone with my boyfriend. She said oh yes, but didn't seem to know that I had seen her the night before when she had been presented to me under the Japanese name of Ishihara. All the time I was dreaming this, I was convinced that it was only a dream. ]]></report>

I felt thrilled and excited. The other members of the gang were friends (male) whom I had gone to high school with. I remember one, in particular, who was leader of my gang. I had dated him in high school once in a while. The gang and myself were hiding behind some huge marble pillars high up on a mezzanine in a building somewhat like a bank. Police were below us and shooting at us. Several members of my gang had already been killed. The leader of the gang was below near the police. He and some remaining members were in a position to watch the shooting and seemed quite worried about me. I could hear the leader asking "is xxx all right?" They haven't shot her have they?" I can only remember that I was hiding crouched behind a huge pillar feeling sure that the police couldn't shoot me. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Dreamed that a friend of mine (18, lives in dorm) was with me in a large cement girl's bathroom. It was dark and gloomy in there and I was quite upset because a large rat was running around the room. I was afraid he would crawl over my feet so I called to my friend across the room asking her if she wouldn't kill the rat by picking it up by its tail and slamming its head against the cement floor. I felt that she was very strong and fearless. She picked the rat up and did as I told her, however, she only crippled it. I felt so sorry for the poor thing writhing about then that I told her to slam the rat against the floor once more to put him out of his misery. When she did this the second time, the rat looked to me like a possum. With this I awoke. ]]></report>

I wanted to go swimming in one of the forks of the river, but couldn't decide in which one. The next thing I remember I was standing on the sand at the shore's edge. I ran, plunged into the river and swam out to a buoy. It seems I had picked the far fork or branch of the river in which to swim. I was with other people in the water, but am unable to remember anything about them (sex, age, etc.). ]]></report>

Just as he was opening the storm door, mother and my brother came up and shut him between the two doors. His head was smashed and the whole scene was very ghastly.

We had our family car at school but we were going to take the bus to Detroit as I usually do when I go home and we were to drive from there. We raced around making plans, buying bus tickets and checking schedules. Then we went down to the bus station and checked our suitcases through. The only trouble was that we didn't know how to get the car from school to Detroit. All of a sudden I realized how silly we were and said we can drive all the way home. With relief we went down and claimed our baggage. ]]></report>

We were going on a trip in the car and the boy and girl were planning to elope and be married. We were going along with them. Next I was standing in a room which represented my bedroom at home and my sister opened a large box to show me an engagement and wedding ring which my fiance had bought for me. I examined the diamond and then began to lift the wedding ring from its place when the scene suddenly shifted. My sister and I were standing in a driveway next to the house where we used to live. There was a beautiful brand new green Lincoln sedan standing there and I got in it and drove away. ]]></report>

The high school classes were held in the auditorium of a grade school I attended in the seventh grade. The teachers who lectured to us were my grandfather and grandmother who have both been dead a number of years. It seemed very natural for them to be teaching the class. We sat there and took notes and then I talked for a long time to my grandmother. It did not seem that she was really my grandmother in the dream. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was in an antique store. It was similar to one that I am familiar with--dark and dusty as these places often are. The store was divided into two partitions--a front room and a back. I was in the other or front room and the proprietress of the shop was showing me various antique articles in which I had no particular interest. I know the proprietress quite well. She exists in real life--a middle aged woman who has gray hair and is somewhat deaf. In my dream either I specifically asked for or she volunteered the information that she had some very fine antique jewelry for which I really have a passion. Garnet jewelry is my special weakness. In my dream I asked eagerly to see it and she conducted me to the inner or back room. The only furnishing I recall was an antique desk with a great many pigeon holes and small drawers. She then left me alone and I heard her shut the door. I pulled open a little drawer and a vast quantity of jewelry--necklaces, bracelets, earrings and brooches--tumbled out. They were all of garnets set in antique gold and I coveted them more than anything else I ever saw. I fondled them greedily and I decided that, since I was alone in the room, I would take them. I was about to put them in my pocket when I experienced a definite feeling of wrong doing. I felt that the Virgin was looking down and disapproved. (I am no Catholic.) I put the jewelry back in the drawer and as I did so I noticed that the stones had undergone a radical change. The deep red of the garnets had become gray--colorless--lusterless. They were nothing but granite pebbles set in gold. Even before I woke up I felt that I had passed a sort of religious temptation test. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was standing on a hilltop. I knew immediately that it was Mexico. Seldom even in a movie have I seen such a beautiful scene. (This was a thoroughly enjoyable dream). It was early dawn. I saw the sun cast long golden ribbons over the softly rolling hills. I swear I felt a fresh breeze on my face. The hills were brown, freshly plowed with long furrows. I even noticed that many of their hills were contour plowed. In some of the fields, white skirted peasants in straw hats were sowing seed with a rhythmical precision. I stood on the hill and looked at everything with a peaceful pleasure. Suddenly I heard shrieks and shouts. I glanced down into a valley and saw many horsemen driving crowds of people before them. The horses reared and whinnied, the riders shouted and cracked whips. The people wept and screamed as they were driven down into a huge ditch. They were forcibly thrown down into it. Their baggage and possessions were flung all around them. I rushed forward and threw myself into the ditch with these expelled people. I learned that they were Spanish but I never found out why they were exiled. I was considerably surprised (even in my dream, which was quite credible) to hear myself announce in ringing tones "I'm Spanish too." I talked in a friendly manner to a little girl of about 8 years. Her name was INES. As my dream ended I was sitting in the dirt of the ditch, quite happily making paper dolls for INES, who crouched beside me. ]]></report>

My sister, her friend and I lounged about talking. Suddenly the back door opened and my father lurched in drunk. I was faintly ashamed that Martha's friend should see him in such a condition. He seemed to have brought with him a florist's box which he laid on the kitchen table (it had a cover on it of red and white checks). It was for me and contained a beautiful orchid. A boy I date at school who lives out of town had sent it to me. Also in the box was a long rambling incoherent letter which seemed to be a declaration of love. I was overjoyed as it proved to me that even though we were separated, he had thought of me. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that I was sitting in the back room of Moe's, a well known college beer joint and one I know fairly well. The back room looked a little different. I can only explain that it seemed to be turned around. I knew however that it was Moe's. It was a very colorful scene, looking rather like a Hollywood version of a dive. There were bluish clouds of smoke, people were dressed in colorful clothes. The scarred tables and chairs were the same as they really are. I was happy because I was in a place I knew well and was fond of. I decided that I would have a beer and called to Al, the bartender, to bring me one. He refused to do so. I couldn't understand this but I didn't feel that I should make a fuss. I felt rather inferior because while I was sitting with people I knew who were very friendly to me, I lacked an escort. Here the dream ended. ]]></report>

I unfolded mine and read the single question printed there. I read: trace the importance of erasers on the control of audio-sound frequencies. With a sinking feeling I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about the subject. I seized my pencil with determination and began to do what so many students try to do on exams--bull around, as it's known. I recall writing authoritatively (hoping I could fool the professor). "It will readily be seen by any intelligent person that erasers are of the most extreme importance, etc." I was quite worried that I would be seen through and receive a low grade.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The dream took place in a hotel where I was staying. There was a lot of confusion and noise. Everyone around seemed to be happy and festive. There were a lot of young people there. I was discussing things of interest with them. Then I was in another room. And in this room, in the bathroom, next to the bathtub, was a huge chair set up high. The chair itself was yellow leather and it was braced with large pieces of wood and made to look like a throne. The bottom of it was decorated in white tile, as was the bathroom. Then I noticed that draped here and there were rhinestone bracelets and necklaces; and gold belts with pseudo-jewels in them. Later I learned that this throne was used as a prop for the stage play of Macbeth. The person to whom it belonged was a young man about 27 years of age. He had dark hair. Someone was asking him how he got so many people to give up their rhinestone necklaces, bracelets and gold belts permanently for the construction of this throne. This man kept saying that the people didn't mind at all. This seemed to cause an argument between the two. Then I woke up. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in a strange house in the town we lived in about 10 years ago. I was about the same age as I am now but it seemed that the time was about 8 years ago. My mother had decided to walk to the corner with the lady of this house who was about the same age as my mother. I said that I would take care of the children (who belonged to this lady) while they were gone. I watched them leave and a few minutes later there was a knock on the door. I thought as I answered it that I should look to see who it was before opening it. But I opened the door and there stood a big man. He was about 60 years of age and was unshaven with gray hair cut in a butch. He looked at me and smiled in a sort of fiendish way. Then he stroked the side of my face and said something I don't remember except that he called me dolly. It made me very angry and I could feel my heart pounding. Then he started to lunge at me and I ran. Pretty soon I found myself going down some back stairs outside the house and the man was gone. I felt weak from fright. ]]></report>

Then we heard police sirens in the distance. For no apparent reason we ran to escape the police. As we were making our way to the back fire escape, we heard someone say that there were three dead people in the ironing room. We stayed on the fire escape until the police left and then went in to look at these dead people. What I saw was not well defined. It just looked like a bunch of old dirty rags scattered about in heaps in the room. I was fully expecting to be horrified and felt much relieved when I could see nothing that resembled dead people. These young men were about the same age as I. ]]></report>

Everyone was very happy and she was to start attaining her divorce the day after this party. Her husband came to the party but left very early (as he always does). I told her how happy Bob and I were for her (Bob is my husband), but I said that after all, passing value judgements upon her life was not my affair. At this odd point I awakened. ]]></report>

She had recently become engaged and was wearing 3 diamond rings. Two of them were in an old-fashioned setting with two stones side by side and the whole shape of the ring was rectangular. The engagement ring which she had just received was in a modern setting and had one large round diamond. As I looked at it, I noticed that there were little curls of something resembling wood shavings and these curls covered up the whole ring. I proceeded to remove these curls, and was surprised that the girl hadn't done so herself. ]]></report>

While I was in the middle of my song some businessmen offered me opera and Hollywood contracts. At that time I was angry to think they would go so far as to interrupt a church service for their own affairs rather than at least wait until it was over. I refused their offer, feeling that if God gave me a beautiful voice, I could well use it by honoring him. Alongside me was a priest and in front of me were people praying. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in the kitchen of a strange house when I heard a woman (about 50) call me to come out to the backyard. I did so and found her to be my boss of last summer. She indicated a man (about 60) who was standing nearby. She said he wanted to borrow my bicycle. I went near where he stood in order to talk to him and started to tell him he, of course, could borrow it. I kept talking and then proceeded to give him reasons why he could not borrow it. I became somewhat angry. It was about dusk. I turned to go in and he followed me. I tried not to show my fear and felt he was going to shoot me, although I had the idea that he followed me inside with evil intentions. I sidled around the doorway into the kitchen and awakened. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[One of my best friends (f, 20) and I were in a classroom. The teacher was one (f, 50) we both had had in junior high school. We both disliked her. She taught sewing there. In the dream she was teaching typing. It was the first day of the semester. My friend had taken the second semester of the course the previous year, while I was new to the subject, not having taken any before. Therefore, my friend had the advantage of knowing the teacher's procedures etc. We were instructed to write a heading on the paper. I made a mistake and the teacher ridiculed me. On the board was a sample of the heading we were supposed to put on our paper. It was written partly in the handwriting of a grade school child and partly in an adult's handwriting. She instructed us to do more things (forgotten now--never remembered clearly) and I did not do them correctly. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I, as my maiden aunt (51), was standing in the front yard of my home in the country. I was not myself, but my aunt. A car drove by in which were my sister (my mother, my aunt's sister) and her husband. I did not determine whether her son and daughter (I) were in the car. I felt very sad that I had no husband while she did. I envied her. Immediately, I changed back to myself (f, 20), although the setting remained the same. I got in my car and followed that of my parents. There were several cars between us. My parents and the cars following approached a curve on an upgrade. The right side had no protection from a considerable drop-off except the guard rail. My parents' car was first in line. Upon executing the curve they came upon a piece of heavy road construction machinery traveling slowly ahead of them. They could not have seen it until rounding the curve. I saw them swerve to avoid it and, in doing so, they went through the guard rail and over the bank. The line of cars halted. I rushed from my car, over the bank to them. My father (wearing a blue shirt) was slumped over a piece of the car, his back toward me and motionless. Farther on, my mother, wearing a red and white figured dress, was brushing off herself. My young brother (11) sat farther on and wore a bright red shirt. I awoke. ]]></report>

I was eating hard candy when I went in and asked her for a wastebasket to put it in. She showed me a sunken wastebasket in the floor. We went to another room where I was in bed and she sat on the edge and we discussed the hours I would work. It was apparently this coming summer and I had taken the job again for the summer. A Chinese child (f, 3) was lying on a ledge to my left. She said she was cold so I told her to go in my bed, which she did. There was another smaller baby sitting at the foot of the bed (m, 1) dressed in blue pajamas. ]]></report>

There women were swimming around holding babies. I got out to the side of the pool. There I saw women preparing the babies to go underwater by holding their noses (the babys'). One woman hit her charge on the chest and then held its nose. They then dove in. Later, I was leaving the building with a friend (f). She was telling me that she had no more money because, to quote: "I just bought ________ (her roommate, f) a tricycle--I mean bicycle". ]]></report>

They tried to persuade me to go with them to get some food, but I knew it was very late and I had to go inside. These friends were angry because I would not go with them and they quickly left. As I was about to enter the door a little squirrel ran up to me and I was frightened. I thought the squirrel was going to bite me. I ran inside. I wanted to find my parents so they could protect me. I started to run up some steps. I ran and ran. The house old and unfamiliar. The stair-steps were steep and I thought I'd never reach the top. When I did, I found my mother. She had been asleep. She was in a night gown. Her hair was disheveled and her eyes looked wild. I could tell she was angry. She told me to climb onto a high table or dresser. She went to get something and I knew she was going to get a knife so that she could cut me up. I started to run down the stairs. ]]></report>

I knew he shouldn't have, but he said it would be all right. The conductor opened the doors at a stop and the dog jumped off and ran down the street. I was worried about the dog and this boy and I got off of the streetcar. We found the dog on the sidewalk outside of a store. I knew the dog was sick and dying. He appeared to be flat against the sidewalk. He was trying to move but he couldn't. I told the boy to get the dog to a doctor but he thought the dog was all right. ]]></report>

They were dressed in brightly colored costumes. The background was yellow. The conductor appeared in a very unusual pink costume, like that of a ballet dancer. The performance was also unusual, for instead of directing the orchestra in a conventional manner, the conductor danced and in this manner conducted the musicians. I thought the performance was beautiful and I said I thought the conductor was very clever and talented. I felt enthusiastic and happy. My mother said in a very disgusted tone, "He's a nigger. do you mean you approve of him?" I was angry and hurt. I hit my mother on her knee in a restrained way and I said, "Oh mother, you always spoil things."]]></report>

I knew that three days later the bomb would hit Cleveland and I wanted to get home as fast as I could. I was with my 11-year-old sister and together we got on a bus. No one had to pay bus fare because the bomb was coming. I noticed we were on the wrong bus and it took us way out to University Heights. My sister and I got off the bus and ran into a stranger's house to call home. My grandmother answered the phone (here I was conscious of the fact that I was dreaming) and I told her I would be right home. Suddenly I found myself at home. I began to cry and had a horrible fear of dying and of the atom bomb. ]]></report>

After one performance some men and I went to Higbee's for dinner, only the restaurant wasn't really that of Higbee's. One of the men (who was my baby doctor) told me to get a job selling at Higbees, but I was very indignant when I told him I was a college graduate and wouldn't sell at Higbees. Then we returned to the scene of the show and bunch of girls and I were in a bedroom or dressing room. Tony Martin and his wife came in and Mrs. Martin had dull red hair and red lipstick on. Mr. Martin's hair was coal-black and I told him her really shouldn't bleach his hair black because men with gray hair, especially those gray at the temples, were very distinguished looking. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that my 2 girl cousins, ages 11 and 15, who live in L.A.; my sisters, ages 11 and 17; and I, were standing in an apartment building somewhere in Cleveland ringing my grandparents' door bell. (My grandfather passed away a year ago, and my grandmother lives in Los Angeles.) My grandparents were supposed to take us on a picnic but no one answered the bell. So my cousins, my sisters, and I got on a streetcar and on the streetcar we met our grandparents. My grandfather told us that they had had to leave Cleveland suddenly to go to Los Angeles because my grandmother's sister had died. I remember him saying "Can you imagine that?" and I felt surprised that he had said that because I knew that my grandparents and my grandmother's sister had never gotten along. Then my grandparents began to playfully argue and everyone on the streetcar laughed. I woke up and, when I did, I felt happy and satisfied because I had seen my grandfather so clearly. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[First I found myself sitting inside a movie theater dressed in a formal gown and my date (whose name I cannot recall) was sitting next to me. Then I found myself on Cedar and Lee Rd. walking with a person, but this person kept changing; first it was one of my girlfriends and then it ended up to be my sister who is 17 years old. Then 2 men began following us (one man I have never seen before; the other one lives in my neighborhood and acts strangely.) I felt horrified that the men would catch us, but the bus stopped for us and we got on safely. ]]></report>

I was very conscious of his dark brown eyes, his dark thick eyebrows, and his dark brown hair. He was of medium height and rather stocky, and between 28 and 30 years of age. I remember feeling extremely happy and very lighthearted. Then my grandmother (who is living in Los Angeles) walked by and I introduced her to the man whom I was with. Then my grandmother walked away after taking a gook look at the man and I awoke.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[It seems I went to a certain party where there were many people. It must have been a hotel. I can only remember one young man there that I recognized and talked to. He is about 28 and an acquaintance of mine. I cannot remember the other young women at the party, but there were quite a few of them, some of whom I seemed to know. There were many small tables and so we must have eaten or drunk something. After a while I seemed to feel very warm and retired to the ladies' room where I rested up for quite a while. After that, it seems I was visiting a girlfriend's apartment with another girl. The apartment was in the Mayflower Village. I have never seen the apartment before but she showed us the living room, which was a light green. While we were there she talked to her mother on the telephone. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[It seems I had a big party at my house. Perhaps it was not so much of a party as a gathering. This gathering consisted mostly of my relatives. I recognized a few of my aunts, cousins, (male and female) and my grandmother. I don't remember serving them anything but drinks and I found myself in the kitchen getting ice cubes. Many of the people came to watch me do this. We sat down at the table for a meal and as I sat down I realized that I was at the table at the downstairs cafeteria at Haydn and I saw one particular girl that I used to eat lunch with when I was a freshman. She is no longer in school and have only seen her a few times since. ]]></report>

The clerk said no, but gave me a whole list of other radios he had. After I had hung up, I realized that I had known the voice on the telephone; it was some boy about 22 that I work with on Saturdays and I had not told him who I was.

We walked down all sorts of corridors and up an elevator (the supposed dorm reminded me of a hospital. Everything was all white and shiny with silver gleaming doors.) We finally got to my room which was filled with laughing pajama'd girls; when we walked in they said Bill had called and would call back. I remember thinking how lucky I was to have a second chance to live the past several months. ]]></report>

Then we began playing red rover. Most of the girls I didn't know--those I did were mere acquaintances of mine at Ohio Wesleyan. They didn't call me for a long time then several times in a row. Then I got tired of all the kids and went home. Our front door was freshly painted white with gold numbers beginning with '1' and I thought to myself that a home shouldn't begin with a number '1'. While I was watching the '1' became an 'f'. Then I walked out in back behind the house. Daddy and mother were sitting in a rowboat fishing and mother was dangling her feet in the water. Mother was wearing blue jeans. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was at typing class which was being held outside our high school building. There were lighted Xmas trees in a semi-circle around us (supposedly to keep out the wind). The teacher was unknown and definitely unfamiliar to me. She gave us a long lecture on how to type and I was very cold and not paying attention. Then she gave us a speed drill and I got all confused and behind and forgot the margins on the side of my paper. I asked a middle-aged woman sitting beside me what the place was. At the bottom of my page I wrote down I never had typing before, thinking I would bet a better grade by doing so. When she passed the papers back, I got a C. I felt conscience-stricken and told her I had lied and amazingly, she changed the grade to an A-. Then Mac, a boy I'm dating now, came in and took my hand trying to get me to cheer up. I began typing again and was doing much better and feeling very happy. Mac was still holding my hand, however. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was a ballerina; wearing a frilly pink dancing dress. I was dancing in, supposedly, Reserve's new student union. There were lots of kids standing around the grill and at the booths. None I recognized however. At the top of a double stairs stood Bill, an old boyfriend wearing a black overcoat, which had the collar pulled up around the neck. I was trying to impress him with my dancing. Everyone else smiled and commented how nice I looked and how well I was doing, while Bill merely glared down at me. Then I whirled around the other direction and two men were sitting on a marble bench and doors shut behind me to separate me from my friends in the other room. I danced before these two, didn't recognize either one, then one of them came over, grabbed my arm and said, marry me, and suddenly his face cleared up and he was a fraternity brother of Mac's whose name I don't even know. I felt very badly because I knew the man was married. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[With some friends, we decide to take a boat trip on a river. We spend the night at the house of two girls, reading wonderful children's books instead of sleeping. The next morning everything is happening many centuries ago and seems as unreal and beautiful as in the books. We are in the 15th century. Our clothes and the boat are those of the century and the river is in the middle of a town which looks like Venice. Then we want to stop and land for a few minutes (to buy books), but when we want to go back to our boat, we cannot, and find that we are surrounded by golden chairs. The building we are in looks like a bank and is made out of yellow and brown marble. But along the building, instead of a street, is the river. Some of our group stayed in the boat, and we are worried about this. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I am walking in a street I Paris. It is about 6 o'clock. Nobody is out. Everything looks quaint and deserted. All the stores are closed and the blinds are down. I really feel all alone in the sleeping town, although it is too early for the people to be asleep. And then a car arrives and stops and my parents and my brother (he is 4 years older than me) are in it. They ask me why I am walking by myself and scold me a little bit. I go in the car with them and we ride through the deserted streets until we arrive home. But I don't recognize it at all. It seems to be somebody else's place. I am very much upset because the others seem to feel at home there, and not notice the difference. They act very natural, don't feel lost in this unknown house. I can just stand next to an unfamiliar table with a lamp on it and watch them, coming and going, and talking, feeling a stranger. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In a big theatre. I am watching an amateur show, supposed to be a college student night, but it turns finally into an ugly bright-colored cartoon. All of a sudden I remember I promised my aunt with whom I live here, to wait for her in front of the theatre. In haste, I rise and leave, disturbing people who mumble at me and run down the stairs, find her waiting outside. Together we enter the theatre again, sit down and watch the program. Soon it becomes boring and all the young people leave the theatre and walk by groups in a nearby park and boys and girls are wearing the costumes the actors had on for the stunt, initially. After a while everybody goes back to the theatre where a very lively ballet is given on the stage. Some people among the spectators say we missed a very good part of the program. Then we are discussing the program in the lobby and soon we are no more in the lobby but back in the park. It is summer in the park with leaves on the trees and it is warm. Outside on the street it is cold, and still winter. ]]></report>

Everything is calm and so peaceful that one does feel like laying down and daydreaming. But I go on with the idea that I have to take a steamer which must be anchored here, some place, and that I cannot find. I am looking for it, but I am not too eager to find it; everything around me is so nice and appealing and makes me feel like staying. I have the impression of being really alone, but I am not concerned about it. On the contrary, I feel very much relieved to have nobody to push me around. Just something very softly in me makes me walk toward that boat which is going to take me home. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was playing with my brother and he was running after me, teasing me. I tried to escape him and fell down on the stairs--oddly made out of green jello which started to shake. After that, I found myself back in my country in the apartment of a young married couple, friends of ours, and saw their newborn baby. I wanted to call my mother to tell her that I was back, but I spent a whole hour and could not correctly dial our number. I knew it but always something prevented me from dialing it right, and I was extremely upset. Finally my mother called our friends, and I answered the phone and felt a great relief, but I did not know how to get home and was mixed up in the buses and subways. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[This dream was completely confusing and uncorrelated. Only a few of the details stand out in my mind, while the others remain obscure. I recall being in Saks 34 St., a department store in N.Y.C., with a few friends of mind. We were all trying on dresses when suddenly we heard an explosion coming from the distance. At this point my dream began to wander between two definite themes--one having to do with something concerning the United Nations building and another having to do with a boat smuggling dope in N.Y. harbor. I don't recall any of the details, except that it was a Coast Guard boat firing on the boat with the dope, which seemed to cause the explosion, but where the various details met I cannot seem to remember. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The only part of the dream which I can remember clearly is where my boyfriend TG and my uncle HT and myself were caught in a flood. I recall the water kept rising higher and higher about us. Finally, we were able to reach a higher piece of land and sought shelter there, but still the water swirled about us. At last the water subsided and we remained in our fixed position, waiting for help to arrive. I recall that there was a great deal of yelling and arguing, because my uncle was very hungry. However, we had no food so there was nothing for him to do but wait. When the rescue party finally reached us, my uncle began arguing with them and wanted to know why they had waited so long to rescue him. The rescue party threatened to leave him if he didn't behave so he kept quiet. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In this dream I remember playing a part in a play. I had done a very good job and many people had told me that I had talent. I was quite enthused and decided to make a career of the stage. I started taking dramatic lessons, but told no one about it. Finally, one day I was given the opportunity to play a small part in a play in Broadway. I was very pleased and excited and quite proud, and I decided to tell my boyfriend , TG, about it. He was very happy for me and encouraged me a great deal. However, when we told his parents, they became infuriated and told me that if I went on the stage I could not marry their son Ted. The last thing I remember is Ted talking to his parents about it and trying to reason with them. Before anything definite had been decided, the telephone rang and woke me up. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[This dream was quite confused and uncorrelated. I remember, in one part, doing a dance in a pair of black velvet leotards (shoes). I don't know where I was dancing or why. Then I recall talking to a boy, BF, age 20, with whom I went to high school. I never really knew him--only enough perhaps to say hello, but in the dream, we were having a long serious conversation. He asked me to go out with him and I remember not knowing what to do, whether to go with him or not. Two of my girlfriends from high school, EL and DG, advised me not to go with him. I thought the only reason Ellen had said not to was because she cared for him a great deal and was hoping that he would ask her out. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I had become pregnant, although I wasn't married. Obviously I had had sexual intercourse (with my boyfriend, TG) although I can't recall experiencing the act in my dream. By the time I realized I was pregnant I was in my second month. I was not in the least bit worried or frightened but even happy, and I told my parents (mother, 45; father, 49) about it. They weren't at all concerned or ashamed of the fact and told me to ask TG to marry me. When I told him he said he couldn't until he finished scratching his uncle IG's back. There was no reason why he should have been scratching it, but he was. I became very angry and spoke to his parents (mother, 52; father 55). His mother told me how unjust that was and said she would speak to him. I also told his father and he became so angry at TG that he began to beat him up. At that point my dream ended, and I was in the stage between being awake and asleep; but I was acutely aware of the fact that I was very married and when I finally awoke completely I was in a cold sweat. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Dreamt about a boy I knew in high school (saw him briefly for about 5 minutes last night-driving past the house and hit our dog). We were out on a date--was wearing jeans and a shirt--discussed where we could go in jeans. He suggested place to eat. Picked up a number of other people all of whom were very strange--didn't know them. Greater part of them were children. We stopped and I had to get out of the car for while--was afraid of seeing someone that knew me, for it was a Friday night and inasmuch as my father is orthodox in his religion, I was not supposed to be riding. Had argument with someone about discrimination and the segregation of the Negro and the Jews. Something came in about stunt night. Seems the boy I asked told me he was able to go. Rest of the dream vague and all mixed up. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had gone down to the Schofield Bldg. Used to work there. Had stopped in to see my old boss and found out that the girl who had taken my place had left. They wanted me to come back to work and I couldn't give them any definite answer inasmuch as I was, or am, presently working. The bookkeeper was there, though she had changed quite a bit. She had now become quite gray, was wearing black and looked very old. I felt a little guilty for not going to work there. While I was there I noticed a number of applicants, all of whom were elderly women and all of whom were wearing black. I left there and went to my job. When I got there I found Bess, the bookkeeper from my former job, now working on my books. She told me she had quit and was now working for my boss. I then thought that this was a good idea as Bess was an accountant and, with her ability, deserved a better job than the one she had. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[It was just before a stunt night rehearsal. I had to find a gym outfit to wear and went to the gym department. At the desk I noticed racks of costumes which the seniors wore two years ago. They were striped black and yellow with purses to match. Also on the shelf were a number of glasses--cocktail or champagne glasses. Finally the teacher came to the desk. It was one of the Mather instructors but, looking around, I realized it was the gym department of the high school I attended in New York. I then went into my gym class and participated in the activities. From there, went down to the locker room and still being confused as to whether I was in Cleveland or New York, I couldn't find my locker. I seemed to have been in a very big hurry. It seems I had to get to another class. A friend of mine helped me find my locker. I also remember something about a rattlesnake which was given to me as a gift. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was going shopping with a girlfriend for a present for a boy I date. We were in a store which itself was a cross between a department store and a dime store. We looked at a couple of ties first. One was a narrow gray tie, the others were white with a design in a slightly darker shade. I didn't like any of the ties and we then looked at sweaters. The one sweater which I did consider was a brown plaid sweater. While deciding, we also picked out a roll of gray wrapping paper with blue ribbon. I couldn't decide whether or not to take the sweater because it had to go with a cocoa brown suit which I knew the boy had. The salesgirl came over and cut off a piece of ribbon so that I could find another piece of ribbon that length which would match the color of the suit. We decided not to take the sweater as it was wool and too heavy and left, taking with us the wrapping paper and the ribbon. We sort of sneaked out as we were afraid the salesgirl might see us. We then decided to buy a nylon sweater instead, a sleeveless sweater. ]]></report>

I believe we were deciding where to go to eat and decided to go to his house instead of a restaurant. I was hesitant about going in but nevertheless did go in. He woke his parents up as I feared we would do. First his father came out; him I remember seeing very distinctly. There was some conversation between us, all of it very vague. Then his mother came out. Both parents were somewhat cold and indifferent to me. Then two girls, supposedly his sisters, came out. He doesn't have any sisters. The two girls were girlfriends of mine, two sisters. We then left and Chuck took me home. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in a mammoth, luxurious house. I was talking to a woman named Juliana, but she ran away after something had disturbed her. I think it was the doorbell ringing. I went upstairs to look for her with a tall, husky boy. We started opening strange doors, and I was so frightened that when I said something about it, he picked me up. Finally we opened the door to a huge bedroom with doors leading into every part of the house and out onto a beautiful terrace. All of a sudden Juliana tried to dash through the bedroom from one door to another, but we caught her before she could get away. Next, there was a very distinguished woman guest in the house. I tried to anticipate her needs, but she told me to get her linens. As I was looking for them in a hall filled with drawers and shelves, I came across numerous used and new toothbrushes. On one of the top shelves I saw a box-file with the numbers 60 and 604 directly below each other. Opposite the 604 were the words Sandra Gordon, very severe case. (I seemed to associate this with an admonishment I had received at my job a few days before.) I was rather surprised to see this, but I went on looking for towels. Finally I went into the big bathroom where this distinguished lady was bathing, and asked Juliana where the linens were. Then I woke up. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was ushering someplace with a girl from the dorm. I thought it was at Severance, only I was in Buffalo. I wanted to go to some hangout where all the kids were, but somehow I thought my mother wouldn't like it. I felt sort of sneaky doing it, and I was relieved when I succeeded in getting away with it. At some related time I excused myself from going somewhere with my mother. I gave such an excuse that she allowed me to leave. But I wanted to go to this place again. I got home sooner than I should have, considering where I told my mother I was going. So I pretended I had been sleeping at home all the while. I didn't think she'd fall for it. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[There was a bunch of little children rolling logs down a hillside. Below the hill was a lake. The kids seemed to be having fun doing this. There was something about a little boy drowning, though I wasn't very upset about it. Then another little fellow was hit on the head, and while he was dying in my arms, I called my paper in New York and dictated a human interest story. For a while at this point I seemed to think I was a man. I held the child and tried to quiet him, but he died while I was holding him. I was grief stricken. The boy supposedly died from a blow on the head by a log, but while I was reporting the incident, I had the idea that he had cancer. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A young couple, friends of mine, were getting married. (I recognize neither of them.) After the wedding, they were fooling around downstairs, with a whole gang of kids surrounding them. Some girl piped up with a cute crack and the groom said: see, I told you what a doll she is (referring to the bride). Later on, they went to bed in my brother's bedroom. Mother suggested various things she ought to do for them. I said she should just leave them alone. She said she had taken care of many couples in that room, and she knew what was best. I still insisted she should just let them alone. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was lying half in my bed which is beside a window and half out on a ledge which seemed to be attached to the window sill. N, a friend my own age, came into the room and stood beside the bed. A black cat appeared on the ledge and I screamed at N to take the cat away, as I dislike them intensely. She picked the cat up and was holding it. I said to be sure not to let it loose in my room. She smiled and dropped the cat, which ran out of the room. A spotted cat appeared on the floor and I screamed again. The cat jumped onto the ledge which was 3 stories up from the ground. I wanted to push the cat off but was afraid to touch it. N. just stood there and watched me. The black cat came back into the room, jumped from the bed to the ledge and touched my leg. By this time I seemed to be having a mild case of hysteria. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamed that it was stunt night. The time was just before the judging of the stunts. I had come into the lobby where there were many people milling around and looked for my date. Someone told me he was in the balcony (my date is an old acquaintance from Lake Erie College where he dated a friend of mine.) N., a college friend, hurried up to me and said P. had come to the show with some other girls from LEC (P. was the girl my date had gone steadily with at LEC). The fact that she had come did not bother me but I did not want her to see me when I got dressed into my street clothes. It seemed that I had a fur coat similar to hers and was afraid that she would accuse me of having stolen it. The strange thing was that I did not know for sure if I had stolen it or not and I had no proof that I hadn't. The lights began getting brighter in the lobby and I wished some of the people would leave because there were so many of them. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was walking down a side street in Painesville, Ohio where I attended Lake Erie College. I met J., a girl I had gone to junior high school with and whom I hadn't seen for 5 years. It was getting dark out and we walked in the shadows as we didn't want to be seen for some reason. We came to a bridge and were stopped by a man who asked to see our passports. There was a small building by the bridge and a lot of Negro men were milling around and some were working with a machine on the sides of the bridge. We didn't have the proper papers with us so someone pushed us and the next thing I knew, I was in a small room beneath the bridge, sitting in some mud. J. had disappeared. There were some people lying in the mud but I did not recognize them, nor could I see them plainly. I kept talking about some letters I was expecting and wondered if I could receive mail where I was. A man leaned over a railing and asked me what I was mumbling about. I told him about my letters, which were very important. He said he would try to get them for me but it would be difficult, as he was a Negro and wouldn't be allowed to go into my room at school. Then he disappeared. I started crawling around this awful place I was in and tried to figure a way of getting out. My main objective was to get the letters which seemed so important to me. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in the basement of a house which was filled with water. I kept swimming back and forth from one end of the house to the other. I thought I was alone until I heard a loud splash. I turned and saw Mr. B. (a married man who lived next door to my family over 5 years ago and I used to baby sit with his daughter.) He swam over to me and I realized that he was naked. I was also but it didn't seem to be wrong. We swam about together and eventually he kissed me and later we had intercourse under the water. I asked him where his wife was and he said she would be down soon. She did come down very soon and saw us together. This did not shock or even surprise her. I kept swimming back and forth until I was very tired. ]]></report>

The lights were very dim and I couldn't see many other people in the club but everyone I did see was colored. This didn't seem strange to me and it seemed that I was almost a Negro because I couldn't think of any white friend's names. Then I was in B's apartment, sitting on a divan with my head in his lap. I had been crying and he was stroking my hair and face. Then I thought of S, the girl who is very fond of B and doesn't know how I feel about him (she's in my class at Mather and we're quite friendly.) All I could see was her face with her long black hair drooping over one eye. ]]></report>

I kept trying to catch his eye and to smile but he refused to look at me and I knew it was the end of our relationship. I felt terrible because I hadn't known he could be so stubborn or get so angry and I was terribly sad. I turned around to look at the boy I was with. He asked, 'what's the matter?' and I answered nothing. He had the most understanding look on his face that I have ever seen. The strange part of the dream was that his face was the only part of the dream in color. I distinctly remember his ruddy cheeks and pale gray-blue eyes, with their understanding expression. My brother, sister in law, and their baby were also in the dream but I can't remember where. The alarm clock awoke me and I was very relieved that our fight hadn't actually happened. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Our family had rented a summer suite in an apartment for summer but we were going to rent it the year round. Mother and I went there early one morning to have breakfast. In order to get to our apartment, we had to pass through another person's. She was a rich widow who was selling all her expensive antique furniture. I remember looking at the price tag on a mahogany table. We were going to rent her apartment when she moved out at the end of the summer. We were right on the lake and I couldn't wait to lie on the beach in the sun. But suddenly it got cloudy while my mother and I were drinking our orange juice. I lay on the sand a while but it got windy and cloudy and began to get chilly. Then suddenly, my older sister, who is 26, was there. She wanted to relax too, but it was too cloudy. I didn't like our apartment at all. It was freshly painted but too dark and the ceiling seemed so low that I had to stoop. I was very dissatisfied with it as living quarters. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was driving home from the show alone, and I was at Richmond and Mayfield or somewhere when I got lost and ran out of gas. I got out of the car and walked up the hill in the snow. Four little boys were playing where my glasses had fallen off so I went back to pick them up. But the smallest boy had [them] and wouldn't give them to me unless I gave him a dime. Then he dropped them and both frames and lenses broke. I couldn't drive without them so I was very angry and made him give me his name and address so I could send his mother the bill (the name was Asa something!). I went home for my streetcar pass so I could go back and get the car. It was cold and night time and I was dead tired and my father couldn't drive me there because his car was broken. It was about dawn when I went outside. In front of our house was a car with a boy I know in it with his three roommates sleeping. I woke them up and the boy held out my car key to me. I don't know why this was so wonderful but I didn't have to go back for my car. There was snow on the ground too. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt I had a date with my ex-husband. Before the movie we met at a drugstore lunch counter and had bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches. While we were sitting there, he started a quarrel about something I can't remember but I know it was petty. Then he walked out. So I bought a box of popcorn and went to the movie alone. It was a downtown theater and an usher seated me as if the seats were reserved. The movie "Hansel and Gretal" was playing. At the back of the show were tables, as if it were a first-class restaurant, so I went back there to sit with my younger sister (20) and my older married sister (26). The waiter helped me off with my coat and I sat with them but we didn't order anything to eat. I remember that it was snowing and slushy outside and we all wore boots. The alarm woke me before the movie started but I vaguely recall that it had suddenly turned to summer and we were out on a terrace. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My parents took in a male boarder, and we were attracted to each other, although we never said anything. We just exchanged glances. Then we had to move and I would have to transfer colleges or board at school which I didn't like. We were going to move to Willoughby, I believe. We went to look for a house and found one on the next street. It was pink and cost $75.00 a month for rent. We went to look at it and liked the big backyard. When we came back to our house, my father was sitting on the porch talking to 2 elderly men. It was summertime. I remember realizing that my father was getting old because he never takes time out to relax long enough to sit on the porch. It made me a little sad. But I was glad we had found a house here so I wouldn't have to transfer schools. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Takes place in the upstairs suite of a double house. Some sort of informal party is going on consisting of friends from various musical groups. No one in particular except a boy, C., my own age with whom I associate a great deal, having known him since childhood. He plays no particular part in the dream, is merely present. A man, B., about 35-40, arrives. We see him first outside in front of the house, standing by a car and talking to several people. Then he is in the room. (He is not particularly popular with our group. He is the leader of an organization to which C and I belong and, in our opinion, doing a very poor job of organizing and leading and being very pompous and conceited about it.) He is holding a thermos bottle of Coca-Cola and he spills some on the shoulders of his overcoat. He pours the rest of the drink over himself, and stands there with a look on his face which is typical, a sort of stupid, self-conscious grin, as if he is worrying about what people are thinking of him. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A theater. I am sitting with R (a boy I have been dating recently who is becoming somewhat of a problem because he insists upon getting serious). We are sitting in a section of the auditorium which seems to be right under the stage, although everything on the stage is visible. The seats are very comfortable, actually more like lounging chairs. A man comes out and leads the audience in some community singing which isn't too successful, since very few know the song. The melody was familiar, but I didn't know the words. Then a Negro dressed in old clothes comes out on the stage. I recall having seen his picture in the radio section of the newspaper as a star. He sings a song, with interludes of a shuffling sort of dance step. The audience applauds, particularly a Negro woman in the front row, and I think to myself as I see that, that this is as it should be. During this act R, who has his arm around my shoulders, kisses me twice, which I permit, but do not respond to as I don't want to encourage him. I look backstage and see a blonde showgirl apparently preparing for the next act. Her size is out of proportion to the people around her and she appears by comparison to be about 40 feet tall. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Setting the back yard at home. A group of neighbors are over visiting. I start pushing some sort of cart down the driveway when a green car turns up the drive. The driver is A (mentioned in earlier dreams). He keeps coming ahead and slowly pushes me and the cart back into the yard (in a spirit of fun). He gets out of the car and I go to find him expecting to be greeted with some warmth, since we had not seen each other for a year, but he is not particularly affectionate. I decide that this is because of the other people around, particularly my mother. I mention to him that I had just sent him a letter since I wasn't expecting him home for several weeks yet and he just shrugs. There are several small children in the yard and we amuse ourselves by playing games with them. ]]></report>

After the flowers had all been arranged and the rest of the class went to get the instructor to show her the arrangement, I decided that the flowers were all crowded into one section and I began to try and rearrange them. It seems that all the flowers started to sink and go under. The red lily-like flower began to fall apart. The instructor came in and said not to bother, but I wanted to make the flowers look better. The dream ended with only the red lily-like flower being visible and rest of the flowers gone. ]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in Haydn Hall, in the snack bar. Girls were selling tickets. One of the girls at the table was a friend of mine. Joan was a freshman. I saw a ring on her finger, but at first thought nothing of it. As I looked at the ring, I finally realized she was engaged. I went up to her and wished her the best of everything. I looked at the ring, which was not small or large, but very pretty and unusual. It looked more like a costume ring than a regular engagement ring. We talked about her future plans. She said that she and her fiance, who was a Beta, were planning on getting married in August. I, at this point, for the first time, noticed her Beta pin and tried to recall when she got pinned. I told her how lucky she was to be getting married and complained about the fact that it would be at least 2 years before I could get married. At this time more people seemed to be coming in Haydn for lunch. Several of my classmates were seated around a table. It seemed as if I was involved in the conversation with the people from my own class and was at the same time trying to learn from Joan if she would be back to school next year. I was interested because I thought the girl was very nice and would be a terrific asset to my sorority.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in one of my friend's home, but I don't know whose house it was exactly. There were boys and girls there that I knew. The boys wore tuxedos and the girls in formals. There was a formal that night and I was waiting for my flowers. When they were delivered, I opened the box and admired the beautiful flowers. Then I suddenly realized that they were pink flowers and I could not wear them with my coral dress. I became quite excited because I had asked for a white flower. Somehow there was another box and in it was a white orchid. I did not want this because of the purple center and because I just do not care for them. I took up the boxes in a very bulky way with the flowers sticking out of the boxes and started going up the stairs to get my coat to go back to the florist and exchange the flowers. As I was going up the stairs, several boys were standing at the top of them, around the railing, waiting for me to go up so that they could come down. I was next in a car going to the florist. My boyfriend Dan was driving. There were 3 people in the front and 3 in the back. Dan's mother was sitting in the back seat with two other boys and I, Dan and another boy were in the front. We were driving through the countryside and discussing the problem of exchanging the flowers.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt I was supposed to go fishing on a fairly big boat. I was near the sea and it seemed evening since the sky was so overcast. It seemed that this expedition was part of a class requirement in which the majority were males--something at that. They were waiting for me and I was trying to get a fishing rod. I called to them to help me if they were in such a hurry, but they wouldn't, so I started picking out and untangling a line I found there in the sand, thinking to drop it in and hold it wound on a stick. They said it would be fine. Then my mother came and said it was so squally that she didn't think she'd go and I thought about it and decided I wouldn't either, so I told them to go ahead and leave. Then later someone came to my house and seemed quite distraught. The ship had gone down and she was grieving for her son. I had been in bed, but got up and began putting on my clothes to go and look for him. I had the feeling, however, that he was dead. I also felt glad that I hadn't gone on the trip. I also felt that his arm was off.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I, with a few others, was in a house and people outside were shooting at us. They had guns trained at the windows so that if anyone showed their heads, they would be shot. I wanted to go upstairs to the bathroom, but was afraid I'd be seen and shot. I debated whether I could crawl up and was afraid not. Once someone threw in the window a jelly bomb, it was yellow. It didn't seem to have much effect. This fight had started after the backroom had been set afire. I forget why. I was told to throw water on it as everything was probably killed by now and there was a row of animals charred, but I don't think they were dead. I was a little frightened. There was a burnt crow and I think the other animals were birds also, perhaps vultures. Oh, I was also afraid someone would get close and stick their gun right through the hole made by the jelly bomb and shoot me]]></report>

The professor was lecturing in front of this little cabin, but my seat was behind it, so I asked him if he minded my sitting in front so I could see, and he said that he did and said to me something about not enough seats, these all being taken and kids took the seats that I had thought I would take one of. Then I looked about for a place to sit and debated sitting on some wooden planks over some watery part, but decided it was to damp. Meanwhile, someone started to talk, seemed like gibberish or maybe she sang. The professor beckoned to me and I realized that he had made me a flat seat to sit on and had I sat down with it where I was, speaker and the prof. sat down on the grass. The seat he had made me was quite wide, so I moved over and invited him to sit next to me. Meanwhile the speaker went on. I was a little worried that the class might think I was brown-nosing, sitting next to the teacher, but I wasn't embarrassed. The dream ended.]]></report>

I told Ray I was afraid because the car was going too fast. He said, "Don't be silly," and we came to a bridge--the countryside was rustic and pretty--a little wood bridge and didn't make the corner and went off into the water, which was quite deep. We got out and I saw myself fluttering upward through the water, but Ray was staying to look for a valuable dress dummy we had with us and not finding, came to the surface only to see the dummy pop out of the water. But I was nowhere in sight. I felt alarm at seeing the dummy, not myself, pop out. The alarm rang. I feel the dream unfinished.]]></report>

All I could see were strange-looking animals running across the road and disappearing behind the trees. Then up ahead of me I saw a large dinosaur coming for me. It looked like it was at least 75 feet tall. I was frightened and started running. I threw sticks and large rocks, but it didn't stop. It kept making funny sounds and knocking down trees as it walked. I ran until I came to a cliff and jumped over. I could feel myself falling and this woke me up.]]></report>

The doorbell rang at my home and a little boy asked me to come over to my boyfriend's sister-in-law, that there was a package for me from someone other than my husband. So I did. When I arrived at the sister-in-law's home, she had opened the box. She said, "Look, isn't it beautiful?" I didn't look. I merely took the whole box and went home. When I got home, I threw the box into a corner and then my husband arrived home and shortly after this the other boy's parents came over and said, "How could you marry someone else when you knew Whitney was coming home?" Then they left the room. I never looked at the box and I wondered what was in it, and how I married my uncle. The dream ended here.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I was sitting in Kulas with my father. There were 6 beautiful chandeliers on the ceiling. While we were sitting there, a bomb fell, but it didn't harm anything and the people continued to sit there and the program went on also. All of a sudden I decided to find my mother. I left my father and went near the back to sit with mother. I had just sat down when they called me up on the stage. They asked me to tap dance. I told them I couldn't dance, but I would sing for them. I started to sing and found myself in my own living room singing for my grandmother, mother and father.]]></report>

I got on a bus and as I was riding along, two of my girlfriends (from Euclid) were yelling to me from a window of a house. One of my girlfriend's house. As I was riding, the bus turned into a bicycle. One of my girlfriends yelling from the window was ill and she wanted me to come in to see her. From the house next door the two girls' mothers were saying hello to me out the window. That was all that there was to the dream.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The dream took place in Rye, N.Y. in the winter. I was with 2 of my friends from Rye and a college friend. We all were at Marie's house, one of these friends. Her house was pictured exactly as it is in reality except that right beyond the yard was a cliff which overlooked the ocean. The drop to the ocean was at least 50 feet. I had on an aqua knit dress, one which I received for Christmas and a large turquoise ring. Extending from the cliff was a long, narrow diving board. My friends and I decided to go swimming and in order to do this, they ahead of me dove from the board into the water which lay way below. Being last and terribly afraid of height, I can remember the terror I felt as I walked out on the diving board. My sense of balance was not constant and I found myself swaying from side to side. Finally I took a deep breath, hoping it would last until I reached the water, and jumped. Then we all swam in freezing water out to a float. When I arrived there, I looked at my ring and the turquoise stone had melted and turned orange. The last thing I remember is that I thought that the stone in my ring had been made out of dehydrated vegetables.]]></report>

The bus came to a stop at a red light and I noticed three policemen, one piled on top of another, in the street. All had been shot and were bleeding. The bus continued and finally stopped in a town. The passengers stayed in the bus except for a friend and myself who got out and went shopping. We heard the townspeople talking about a maniac who was shooting everyone. We entered a 5 and 10 cents store and were looking at the displays when all of a sudden the maniac was before me. I say me because at that time my friends were gone and I was alone. The trigger-happy maniac was an old white-haired hunched over man with a crazy sort of a smile on his face. He shot at me at least 5 times, and finally I ran back to the bus bleeding greatly. The bus left and my dream ended.]]></report>

Mother rode in front with him. I rode in the back. Found out he had just gotten out of the hospital. For some reason he kept scratching his head and asked me for a Kleenex so I thought he had had a head operation. Then I just forgot he was even there as I talked to mother and tried to convince her that he should stay at our place.

The donkey only had a halter on, but the boy was a good rider--made him run and buck. The donkey was very alert looking--had a face like my cat. We put him in the stable and went away--later I came back because I wanted to ride it secretly, and found he had grown much larger and was all bloated up from eating a pile of alfalfa that had been left in there. Boy surprised me by coming in. He was mad--thought cruel uncle had left alfalfa there on purpose. Uncle lived in house built way up in the air with dangerous steps leading up to it. He was keeping a man prisoner there by taking the man's glasses, because he (man) was almost blind and was afraid to go down the steps without his glasses.

She reintroduced me to all the younger people who were very friendly. At one time there were three of us girls and three fellows walking somewhere. One boy was the one I had dated a while ago and one girl was from college. We were all carrying little suitcases--I had left home to come to church because of some argument at home. When we went in church, I sat with my mother and sister as part of the service, a woman came driving down the aisle in a jeep, drove up the steps to the altar, turned over as she turned around, but righted herself and drove back down. Mother was also in service somehow, but I can't quite remember how.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was driving in a car with a man. Evidently I must have known him very well because there wasn't the slightest fear or question in my mind. We were driving someplace near Berea because things I saw seemed very familiar to me. It was getting dark and we had absolutely no idea of where we were and I kept having the feeling I was looking for something. As we turned down a dirt road, I saw first a quail and then a big dog which my companion said was a fox. We were getting worried and I was becoming frantic looking for something, when we saw a sign that said Strongsville. We knew we were okay then and we drove into Berea from the south side of town. I still had the feeling of looking for something. As we drove into Marting parking lot, another man I know very well came out to meet us with a white mask on his face. It was then I woke up.]]></report>

Roosevelt. It seemed there was a gang of men who were to kill the president. The house was continually under fire and once or twice I was hit by bullets. The most amazing thing was the calmness which Roosevelt kept throughout. We were unprotected for several days in this house and still Roosevelt kept smiling and was serene through it all.]]></report>

But he was in four sections. I was horrified and quite broken up about it. Also I didn't know how to tell my sister as I had to tell her several years ago of the death of another dog of ours. While I was pondering on this, a dog that looked just like ours walked in. But I was sure that it wasn't ours. The remainder of the dream was concerned with trying to decide whether or not the dog that was alive or the dead one on the street was ours as they both looked alike.]]></report>

Barbara Ayres, a sophomore here, climbed out. Everyone was quite surprised to see that it was she. Babs left the plane on the lawn and went into the dorm. Joe Warner, a senior, appeared and claimed that the plane was his. Nobody seemed to question why Babs was flying it. The plane was the smallest one I've ever seen. There were two seats, one behind the other, and an average individual could just fit into it. Lee Ellsworth, another senior, told the onlookers that it took 9.4 seconds to get off the ground if Joe did it. Suddenly I was in the driver's seat and Joe asked me if I knew where the throttle was. It was under a rubber mat on the floor. The instrument panel had very little on it. But I got it started in 9.0 seconds. I went off the ground and Lee was yelling at Joe that I beat his take-off time. Then I landed.]]></report>

Everybody in my group, consisting of B-W students, seemed to know this fellow. He evidently had been a student here, but I couldn't quite catch the name. The next week I discovered it was Jack Obert. He was pinned to a sorority sister of mine, but she didn't seem to be affected. I remember going by the Lambda Chi house and I wondered why they didn't have a black wreath on the door. In what seemed to be the next week in the dream, I learned some of the details of the crash such as it happened in Euclid and a truck crashed into a car in which Jack had been a passenger.]]></report>

Then I was in somebody else's room and I noticed it was 8:45. I was frantic and I hadn't even pressed my formal yet. So I started looking around for an iron and all of them were busy. In fact, all the girls who were using the irons were going to use them for several hours. I was frantic, but I hadn't received my parlor call yet. Then I went to a sorority sister's room. She was going to the formal, but the fellow she was going with was on the baseball team which had to play at Toledo that afternoon. Suddenly he appeared for her earlier than we had expected and she left in bobby socks. I was about the last one left in the dorm and I wondered where my date was.]]></report>

I couldn't answer it because I would get campused if Mrs. Sanky saw me in their room. I couldn't lock the door because we aren't allowed to have our doors locked. So either way I was campused. She pushed on the door and I pushed back. She pushed me over and got in the room. I was on the floor and she was standing over me. The dream ended.]]></report>

I looked and looked and finally went to the third floor to look for them. It was still dark--but a little lighter. Then I saw a bunch of kids from home. I talked to all of them at first. Then I was talking to this guy who I used to go with. We talked and then argued and then laughed. Then he crawled out the window and I had a party with the other kids. But I was unhappy because this guy left and I didn't have my biology studied for the test. I was also worried because I was going to be campused because I didn't go straight back to the dorm.

It seemed strange since we both own our own house, but she told us that she and her husband had become our landlords. Later I was upstairs sitting on the attic floor in my plaid formal, looking at the boxes. She had a whole box of stockings and a large box full of evening purses. I thought that she was a hoarder because of the stockings.]]></report>

After looking at a pink jacket and hat which was dirty, we went across the street to another store. Sonja, my niece, ran ahead. When mother and I got there, she had already picked out her hat and had it in a bag. As we were going in the store, I told mother that a natural straw would be nice with Sonja's coat which was bright green and I pointed out just such a hat. Sonja put on her chosen hat which was an ugly shade of green with a bonnet brim trimmed with brown ribbon. She was determined to have it so we got it. When we went to the car, we had other packages. I was afraid to have my sister see Sonja's hat because it looked terrible with the coat.]]></report>

We decided to stop and see a mine. My husband has been there before. It was a peanut mine! We walked down many stairs and could see miners going down another stairway. We finally came to an elevator. It was in the shape of the peanut man which is in advertisements so much. I was frightened to get in it, but my husband told me it was all right. I was to count to ten aloud so that he would know when to take the next elevator. I was terrified because I didn't know when to start counting.]]></report>

There was a chair under the door knob on the outside and as I tried to remove it, the woman shook her head no. I then realized the store was probably being robbed, so I tried to get out of that doorway and into the one next door before the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally after what seemed to be a great struggle, I did it. I stayed there for a while trying to make myself small. The store wasn't open and there was no one on the street. I began to worry that the man would come out and see me, so I decided to venture farther down the street. Again, my legs wouldn't move. The last thing I remembered was that I was glad I didn't get the money for the money I cashed in.]]></report>

One day an American ship was coming in; the last one before the hard winter season. I took my class to see this ship. We went through it from top to bottom and I received photos of it to teach the class what it looked like. Before we were able to get off, the boat left shore and there we were, on the boat. I was frantic, worried sick and almost panicky. Then what did I see but my husband working with the crew. He let down a life boat, put all the children in it and sent them back to shore. There was no room for me in it, so I had to stay aboard ship. The ship gave a big lurch and I woke up from my dream. I was very confused.]]></report>

It was a one-building school and had no dormitories, so I didn't know where I was going to sleep as I didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel. There was another girl with me, but I don't know who she was. Somehow there was a huge grocery store in the school and I was going around picking out food that would last a long time so I wouldn't starve. The superintendent was following me around giving me all sorts of tests for entrance to the school. Suddenly I decided not to go there and I found myself in the little town I used to live in in New York State enrolling in some kind of a college that was connected with the high school. They also gave me a lot of tests and I wrote down the subjects that I wanted to take. I said that I wanted one of my Medina, Ohio high school teachers to teach me all the subjects.

There were to desks, one being black and two dressers. Two pictures of my roommate were hanging on the wall. The floor was completely covered with maroon carpeting.

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing at the kitchen door when suddenly two of my cousins whom I haven't seen for quite some time appeared. Nothing happened or was said except that they thought I had changed a great deal since they last saw me. Then I was outside holding a little girl (in a white dress) in my arms while at the same time I was dancing the polka. Someone was laughing at me because I looked so funny. For some reason I felt cramped for space. Next I found myself sitting on a porch swing, but when I saw my grandfather coming, I tried to hide between the swing, and instead of there being a solid wall behind me, it was open and he saw me. My sister was sitting on the swing and she said he found me because my feet extended out beyond the swing.]]></report>

The water was quite black and we were hanging onto the side watching others dive in. We suddenly found ourselves in another section of the pool, but this was blocked off from the larger part. As we stood in the water, Dorothy Williams, the student instructor, told us we couldn't swim there because there were holes in the cement wall and very likely someone would slip through. Miss Stover, the teacher, came over and as she stood on top of the cement wall, she told us the same thing that Dorothy did.]]></report>

However, there were two people in back of me who were rushing to catch the Berea bus as I was, so I put all my strength to keep up with them. It bothered me that neither of them offered to help me. Suddenly a bus went by, but I didn't know whether it was a Berea bus or a Cleveland transit bus, because the sides were green like the Berea buses, but the back was yellow like the CJS buses. Somehow I seemed to overtake the bus and the front was also green but I couldn't see the sign telling of its destination. The bus was suddenly gone and I kept walking. There were two little girls in front of me pulling a sled and I asked them if I could put my baggage on the sled. I did and held it to keep it balanced.]]></report>

It's a fairly large sized pond, but no one hardly ever swims in it due to the numerous cattails and seaweed growths. It is known to have no bottom because of its base of muck. Well, on with the dream. It wasn't an especially different dream, not even exciting. Tom and I were simply swimming around. I remember remarking what a good tan he had. Oh yes, once as I was getting out of the water, the top of my bathing suit came down. Tom didn't seem to notice it, though, so I fixed it and we went on swimming as before. Pretty soon three boys came up. I believe they were supposed to be cousins from Pennsylvania. I recognized one named Mickey, but the faces weren't familiar. I introduced them all to Tom who by the way is my boyfriend. The next thing I remember is being at someone's house, but I don't remember where or who was there.]]></report>

Jumping fence after fence, in what seemed to be the same paddock, my horse was frantically trying to escape these men. Finally the strange men must have given up for I heroically entered the paddock and easily captured him. I remember bridling him and then what happened I don't know for I seemed to be on some sort of a wooden contraption that bobbed up and down in an odd way. Some person was walking with me when I was on this wooden board-like affair. Everyone seemed to be in good humor, at least I don't recall any bad feelings among anyone.]]></report>

Someone else was evidently driving the car when we saw a lake and decided to go swimming. There seemed to be a lot of other people in swimming and enjoying themselves. Somewhere Jim left the dream, and I found myself swimming in a slimy lake full of seaweed, fish, etc. I had a strong desire to get out (no doubt due the slimy lake and fish--both for which I have a strong dislike). When the dream ended, I was out of the water, just standing there on the dock watching the others swim and wondering why they didn't mind the polluted lake.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Many people were at a house. In the dream it was our house, although there was no similarity to our real home, except perhaps the yard. Again my horse Tom enters the picture. I had left him tied outside in the yard and went in the house for something. Looking out of the window, I saw to my horror a young girl on Tom riding down this yard with 2 adults a man and a woman who had evidently given her permission to ride him. I was furious when I saw her on him (I never permitted many people to ride him as most people don't who use their horses for show, due to the fact that their way of going can be spoiled for the person showing). I believe I was a bit jealous too. These 3 people were running the horse very fast down a hill. My shouts to them to stop were useless. Struggling fiercely, I tried in vain to get outside, but people held me back. I hit at people and cursed them, but both blows and words were also useless. I remember one elderly lady seemed to be very shocked at my vulgar actions. She couldn't seem to understand my feelings to the circumstances involved. Directly outside the window was a tall steep wall, evidently the banking to a lawn. The wall must have been 12 ft. high and over the top I saw my horse plummeting downward. I was terribly upset, but still my struggles to get to him were futile, although no person was actually holding me back. Tom didn't seem to be hurt too badly, but someone evidently thought he was in misery and shot him. I was terribly hurt, depressed and sad.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Last night I dreamed I was in a garage which was on an incline. Parked in the garage was a Cadillac convertible. It was blue. There was a hose on the floor and I remember picking it up and spraying water all over the car. I can still see the water hitting the car and spraying back on me and the floor. My father came into the garage and said that wasn't the right way to wash a car. Dad said I should stand closer with my finger over the nozzle of the hose and wipe the water and the dirt off with a rag. When he left the garage, I went back to the former way I had been doing it. All of a sudden the convertible top opened a little and I squirted water into the inside of the car. I remember I felt suddenly frightened and tried wiping up the water.]]></report>

Somehow, when it was time to submerge, the only person going down was me. I don't' think I was frightened, but I was a little nervous because the man who was to go with me was late. I can remember worrying that my hair was going to get wet and that I was having trouble wrapping a scarf around my head. Finally the man arrived and ordered me to get into the contraption which was like a diving bell. I can remember the opening was a little below the water and I had to hold my breath in order to get inside of it. It was very damp inside and there was water on the floor. We finally took off and I waved goodbye to daddy and my mother from the peep holes.]]></report>

When I answered, I found I was listening to a record of a quiz program. The voice I heard was that of a boy who I have known for about 3 years, but not known too well. He was being asked a question which I think he must have answered correctly because he was given a reward. After that I found it hard to hear, so I hung up. The girls standing near me kept saying, "We told you so."]]></report>

After each few steps upwards, the pictures would become more beautiful. The depicted rooms were not ultra-modern or of another age-they were beautiful, but simple. I finally saw the end of the stairway and ran as fast as I could, hoping that what would be beyond would be something special. When I got to the last step, I looked down and there was a beautiful garden far below. In the center of the garden was one small clump of red roses which seemed to stand out more than anything else.

She told me that it was available, but she had another one on the 3rd floor, number 18, which I might like. We went up to see it. (In real life, the suite is directly above my own suit, but is number 17.) She opened the door and I was astounded by the vastness of the rooms (again, in real life the rooms in the building are all very small). The rooms were ultra-modern. I was very pleased to take the apartment, but my husband then came up and said no. Mrs. Beals was very nice and pleasant.]]></report>

I came upon the Hippodrome Theater and noticed the billboard outside which had a picture of two men fighting on a rocky hillside. Suddenly one of the men was me. We were both bleeding. At the bottom of the hill a car was parked. We were rolling along the rocky hillside, going down. Another car came along at the bottom of the hill with people walking beside it. I thought that somebody would come and help me, but the people just watched a while and then left.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I found myself standing on the corner of W. 48th and Bridge Ave. On the corner stood a dilapidated old house. There was no door and I walked in. The house was being remodeled. The interior was very beautiful. I noticed one very large wall near an archway; it was completely bare. Adjacent to it was another wall. This wall was very narrow and cluttered with lamps. I walked down a corridor and came upon 4 bedrooms, then I heard footsteps and quickly hid behind a door. A young man walked in looking for whoever had been making the noises. All of a sudden I discovered that I was unclad. I then realized it was twice as important for him not to see me. Then all of a sudden he found me, but I was fully clad when he did. We walked to the front part of the house and there I noticed his wife. She was pregnant. They were both friendly to me; they explained that they were looking for a place to live and found this house. The lady who owned the house was against renting to young couples, but changed her mind when she saw how beautiful the interior was. I remember very well that the man's wife was very sweet and smiled constantly.]]></report>

I was laying on a driveway from someone's house. There was a girl sitting next to me, but cannot recall who she was. My psychology professor lived two houses down from where I was. His automobile was parked in front of his home and at this time he was standing by the two of us carrying on a conversation. As I looked up from my pillow, I could see him smile at me. That was all I needed because I really had a mad crush on him. He offered me a few pretzels he had and before he offered the girl any, I gave her a 2 cent long pretzel since he had those thin ones. The professor was quite disturbed over this and started for home. Later I went to him and apologized for giving her a larger pretzel than what he had.]]></report>

My psychology professor was sitting watching these girls play and I went toward him, sat down and started to talk. Then I found myself pushing a cart down in the flats (Scranton Rd.) After making a left turn, I had to cross a bridge. The bridge was closed, making it possible for a boat to pass. But I was going to try and get across before the boat came near. However, there was a long stump of wood across the bridge which made it impossible for me to go over. At this time the professor came to me and said something. Later in the dream I was with one of my girlfriends here in the dorm, but do not know where we were. We were just talking.]]></report>

Everyone was afraid to walk across the water because these seals could bite so hard they could kill a person. However, they wouldn't bother you if you stood still. All the people had their legs tucked under them and were on the rocks. I decided to walk across the water. When I did, not one seal bothered me.

			<report><![CDATA[This dream concerned a sorority sister who was planning to be married soon; a sort of preview of the wedding. The auditorium was filled with thousands of people. There was an altar like all churches, but there were no pews. The people were sitting on stone bleachers. I was to be one of the attendants in the wedding and although not the maid of honor, I was to bring the groom's ring. The bride to be informed me that the ring was on a table near the altar and I was to pick it up before the service. The processional started and I followed the maid of honor down the aisle. I picked up the ring and started to leave the altar to go to my seat in the congregation. At that point, my costume was changed and I was just a spectator. The bride became frantic as she looked for the ring. Then I suddenly stood up and shouted, "Here it is." I tried frantically to get it to her, but too many people gathered around me and refused to let me through. At this point, the scene changed and I was with a group of friends, both male and female, eating in the hold of a ship. There were shells and mounted fish on the walls, and a foul fish smell. Everyone began talking and laughing and then I woke.]]></report>

There were only girls and strangely, none of us had on any clothing. We were walking along nonchalantly when we saw a group of boys leaning on a fence. They were near some cars in a parking lot and were watching us approach. Showing no marked concern, some of us turned around and walked back a short distance to dress, while others merely stopped and dressed standing where they were. I was one of the first ones going across the field and just as I turned, I saw one of the two girls I recognized, both freshmen on campus, hold out a pair of red pants and put them on.

			<report><![CDATA[We were sitting around the kitchen table when there was a knock at the door. It was late at night and we were startled for there are not many houses around us and not many of the people keep late hours. It was a peculiar knock--not like one people usually use. My father got up slowly and went to the door, opened it and saw the tramp. He immediately gave the screen door a push, the force of it sending the man reeling off the wide step onto the ground. My dad went out after him and a fight began. I was afraid he was going to hurt my father, so I picked up a knife and ran out the door. Mother following me. We stood there and watched the fight for a short time. Then, using the knife I held in my hand, I slashed at the tramp several times, until there was a great amount of blood on the ground. My father overcame the tramp, but being completely exhausted, he collapsed on the ground. Lying there, he appeared to have three hands. This woke me up. (The tramp was probably in his late 30's or early 40's.)]]></report>

Nothing seemed to be going right. During the various numbers, the lights would go out and the spotlights would not be shining on the swimmers. Instead, they were flashed in the faces of the audience. The girls in the show were not in their positions on time and throughout the entire show, some were sitting on the pool edge kicking and splashing while watching the others as they went through their numbers. Also some of us were sitting out on the bleachers watching. In addition to this, all of the girls were laughing and talking and calling out corrections to the swimmers in the water. Another thing, we weren't wearing the new yellow suits, but had on the old swim suits which we had used for practicing.]]></report>

Our fruit cellar seemed to be very well stocked. In fact, it was overcrowded. We were living in our basement recreation room and using the fruit cellar for a bomb shelter. Outdoors bombs were being dropped, but the only visible damage was the presence of huge holes in the streets. There were road blocks at close intervals along the street and I was unsuccessfully trying to push my grandfather's large two-wheeled cart down the middle of the road. This seemed to be piled high with cabbages of all things, which weren't in the best condition. During this time, the blond lad was hiding in the house peering from the front window of the bedroom which was mine while I was in high school. All day he sat there focusing my dad's binoculars on the enemy soldiers who were patrolling the five points in front of our house. Only at night did he leave the house. At this time we would go for walks together.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I found myself in an apartment where I lived about 12 years ago of my life. Before I had a chance to look around, the landlady's daughter (35) came out and hugged me. This part of my dream was peculiar, because during all the years we lived in that apartment, this lady never cared for me. She took me up to visit our old suite of rooms. In reality the rooms are quite small and plain. In my dream the rooms were spacious, light and beautifully furnished. The sun seemed to be streaming into all of the rooms. There was a lady in the rooms whom I thought I recognized, but she wouldn't look at me, so I couldn't be sure.]]></report>

I wanted to join in the pageant, but I seemed spellbound. Suddenly something happened and I was in the midst of the aqua group. I knew just what part I had to do and I did it.]]></report>

I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a serving basket and removed a cloth with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him.]]></report>

I stood in the line at first and then finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend.

In the dream I suddenly found myself on the front porch of the dormitory I live in. X, with whom I am in love and date steadily, was standing at the foot of the porch steps and asked me out of a clear sky for his identification bracelet. He said he was in love with someone he had just met and that is all there was to it. This shocked me immensely and I begged and pleaded with him, but he would not listen. I ran into the house and brought out the bracelet, then very ceremoniously I fastened it on his wrist. He left without a word and the next thing I knew, I saw him in Mill Creek Park in Youngstown, Ohio, with this girl. A horrid feeling of lonesomeness, longing, and envy came over me. I burst into tears and began to run. I ran and ran for ages it seemed, then I woke to find this lost, depressed feeling still prevalent. It lasted through the day until I saw X again and told him about the dream.]]></report>

I understood it to be new, but it turned out to be a made-over model of my aunt's old farmhouse. I was disgusted with the whole thing, but I tried not to let my parents see it. I kept exclaiming how each thing was so nice and at the same time was trying to figure out in my mind how they could possibly like the atrocious thing. I remember the wall between the living room and dining room was nothing but a huge aquarium. The kitchen had absolutely none of the latest conveniences, including no linoleum. For some reason, I began to search for my old bicycle and was awakened at this point.]]></report>

Dad and mother were angry and nervous. I kept wondering why he didn't, yet it seemed as if it was the fault of the people serving us and not his. The wine was delicious and I wanted more, but I was afraid to take it. Then I was eating a cream cottage cheese salad with peaches on top. Still the toast wasn't made. There seemed to be confusion at our table and soon we were being served steak. Then I thought it was too late to make the toast.]]></report>

I became very angry because the stock was mixed up. Then suddenly the thing that was hindering me from finding the shoes was dresses in front of the shoe shelves. I was worried because the customer who was a lady seemed to be getting angry at me for taking so long to find her shoe. I went up to Dad who was the manager and complained about the condition of the stock. He told me where to find the shoe. Even then I couldn't get it. I hurriedly started sorting through pots and pans and all sorts of articles. I couldn't understand why they should be in a shoe store. I was very angry at my father for putting so much junk in a shoe store. I could hear the customer complaining about inefficiency.]]></report>

In front of me I noticed my girlfriend Mary. She said she was married. Her husband turned out to be a man much older than she was with a bald head showing through his thin hair. He also had a mustache. I was shocked she would marry such a person. I started to go up the aisle in order to kiss the cross. I noticed that I was carrying something in my hand. It was a bottle of cologne. The cologne was very yellow. When I came back, I saw my other girl friend. I looked for a fellow from school that I knew, but I couldn't find him. There was also a fellow that I had known two years ago. He was someone I had liked. I was supposed to go to a party he was giving after church. I felt how inappropriate a party was on Good Friday. I felt guilty that I should plan to go.]]></report>

When he came, I found out he was married to my cousin who was staying with us at the time. He was dating me in order that he could see her. They had kept their marriage a secret. My first reaction was that I was glad he married her instead of me. Then I was surprised and puzzled why my cousin would want to marry him. I didn't consider him a desirable husband. I had refused to go out with him and had even told her I didn't like him. Then I was riding in the car with them as they were going on their honeymoon. He held her hand and again I couldn't understand why she wanted to marry him. Then I was angry that they had used me in order to keep their purpose a secret.]]></report>

I had to go away for some reason and it seemed as though someone went with me, but I don't remember who it was. When I came back again after about a year, everyone was changed and I was very sad because of this. The next part that I remember was in a bathroom. It was quite large and had a very large bathtub. Two girls were drawing water for a bath. One of the girls was a friend of mine who lives in the same dorm I do. She had her towel around her just as she always does before taking a bath. She was very excited because she was going to take a bath in such a big tub.]]></report>

As I passed one rather large house, music floated out to me, and I became quite angry because I could not think of the name of the piece. It began to rain then, but instead of hurrying on my way I stood and listened to the music. I was just about ready to give up when a low soft voice said "don't you remember that, my dear." I turned, but no one was in sight. Then the voice said, "that is Beethoven's 4th. How could you ever forget." I looked frantically around but could see no more. Something made me look at the house for a moment, and for a second I saw a lovely face watching me. She seemed to be crying, yet I wasn't sure. The rain came down harder, the music ceased, and I walked on alone.]]></report>

They were fresh, as ice had not yet formed in the print, and I was very excited. All of a sudden, there it was, at least an eight pointer. I took aim and fired. He fell, but scrambled up at once and hurried off. I gave him a good half hour start and then followed. In an hour or so, I found him bleeding in a little gully. But now as I looked at him trying so desperately to get up and run away, I became sick to my stomach and ashamed of what I had done.

Somehow he let me know that he was the fellow who had robbed several gas stations and stolen a stamp machine from a friend of mine. He then told me that he hadn't intended to rob the station, but when he saw how easy it would be and thought how much money was available that he just threatened the attendant and took the money. He didn't mention the stamp machine. I put gas in his car, and he paid me and left.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in the gas station where I work about 34 hours a week, and instead of half of all the employees being there for one shift there was the whole total present which only served to heighten the confusion. Cars were piling in from every direction and stopping in the middle of the drive and blocking traffic as they often do. No one was directing them to proper positions so that they could be serviced, so I was trying vainly to establish some order. The situation grew worse and worse, and each attendant seemed to fell that he was working all by himself with no thought of teamwork. The new boss who was there was just walking around giving out simple useless orders and making the situation worse. As the confusion grew, I became more irritated and the dream faded.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was on a beach, and a storm was coming up. There were many people with me. All were friends, but none of them were associated to me in reality. A storm was coming up, and everybody was scurrying for safety. It was a threatened storm of hurricane proportions. I ran, calling my little son (2) out of the water, and started up a long fire escape-like stairway leading up a cliff off of the beach carrying the boy. The fragile stairs were sagging and falling apart in pieces, and I kept crawling up and up, carrying my son. Then I was at the top, and the wind died down, and I was in a big house with more people (friends with no names), and I wondered where my father was. I was sure that he had been trapped on the beach and that the stairs were destroyed before he could get away. I ran to look, and when I got to the cliff he was just coming over the edge. I asked him how he did it, and he said it was easy.]]></report>

I was not going very fast when all of a sudden an old man was in front of the car, and I couldn't stop it. I hit the man and killed him. Immediately a motorcycle policeman drove up beside my car, handed me a piece of paper, told me to sign my name on it. I signed the paper without reading it, and the policeman immediately drove away. I did not know what to do. I returned to the place where I had hit the man, and I was walking this time. As I came to the exact place where I had hit him, the earth under my feet sunk about three feet. I tried to blame the defect in the earth as the cause of the accident.]]></report>

As the train passed by a pier, I remember showing someone standing near me my ship. I did not dream that I was on the ship at any time. As the train progressed, we passed huge piles of scrapped equipment. Large number of men would jump off the train and attempt to hide in the scrap piles, and armed guards roamed through the scrap piles and found the men almost as soon as they had hidden. I do not know where the train was going nor why I was on the train. I remember that I tried to escape from the train and hide, why, I do not know, unless it was because so many others were. I was successful in finding a place to hide, I remember running into an old barracks building and thinking that it was a good place to hide because somehow I knew that the guards wouldn't search in the building.]]></report>

I was so very, very happy that I started to dance around. I then awoke.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing in a railroad station. The location of the station was unknown to me, and all I noticed about it was that it was very bare and desolate. There was a great crowd of people in it, but I could not distinguish any of their features. As I stood there, I saw a man in an Army uniform of the first world war. I was puzzled because I could not distinguish his rank. On one sleeve he a had a red major's star, and on the other sleeve he had a gold and black private's stripe. I was looking for someone but could not find anyone due to the large group of soldiers that were boarding the train under the direction of this one soldier described before. As I watched, a soldier came running up to the station and just managed to board the train as it pulled out of the station. The thought struck me that the soldier was a girl that used to live next door to us, but had moved many years ago. I began to chase the train yelling that the last soldier was a girl and did not belong on the train.]]></report>

It was made up of blue pants and a red cap. The brightness of the red color bothered me. I was looking for my girlfriend, although I knew that I would not find her. As I walked along a woman Marine came along and took my arm. She seemed to be a stuffed dummy, because her arm felt like cloth stuffed with sawdust. I turned to ask her if she knew where I could find my girlfriend and found that she had disappeared. I then stopped at my car, but found in its place an old green Model T Ford which was crowded with a group of my fraternity brothers. They were going to a football game at a stadium which was very close to where the car was parked. I could not recognize any of them and took it for granted that they were my friends. They gave me two tickets to the game, and then they also disappeared. I was left alone holding the two tickets and wondering where I could find a girl to take to the game.]]></report>

I kept trying to open a window because my girlfriend was walking along beside the train, and I wanted to help her get on. The train never seemed to leave the station, which was on the order of a small town's loading platform. Yet I saw the scenery moving by.

Somehow an official of the firm learned of my knowledge and held me in captivity. After a while in captivity I was able to get word to an outside person. However, this didn't have any results. But after a while I escaped. As soon as I got away, I went to the police and told them my story. Then the police and I went to this building and alerted all the innocent people who were working for other firms. The police then staged a raid, but still the criminals wouldn't give up. Then the police used tear gas, and the criminals finally gave up. Then there seemed to be some time elapsed, and the next thing I can remember is a photographer taking my picture in front of the building, and the picture was to be printed in the next issue of the newspaper.

During the operation the surgeon, Dr. Beck became very irritated because the stomach became hemolized, and the anastomosis was clotted. Then Dr. Beck's assistants also became irritated, and everything seemed to go wrong. But finally after the injection of a certain drug, the clot was dissolved and everything was fine again. After the operation Dr. Beck thanked everyone in the operating room for having patience with him during this trying operation on this specific patient. Dr. Beck is a man of about 55 years of age and professor of neurosurgery at University Hospitals, and his assistants were men in their late 20's who are serving their residencies at University Hospitals,]]></report>

Well, most of the crowd went after the men, and I and two other unidentifiable men went into the men's room to see what damage the shot did. When we got in there, we found a small baby (about 1 year) lying on the floor and bleeding profusely. We tried to do what we could to stop the bleeding; however, the baby died.

I stayed at my window until they were naked to the waist, and then someone from our house called me to the front. I was very perplexed because I had to move.

She, also, was angry at me because she said we had seen each other on campus a few times, and I had not said anything to her. I jokingly took her in my arms and was kidding her about my not having ever seen her. At that moment the alarm rang.

			<report><![CDATA[I could hardly forget this dream as it involved the young lady I was extremely interested in at the time. The dream was merely this. I apparently was standing on the street, and she approached me. Very passively she walked up to me, and without any greeting she said that she would like me to see her engagement ring -- extending her arm as she spoke. As I looked at the ring, I couldn't even feel involved by sentiment. In the dream I was at that time concerned by the fact that I was not overcome by emotion nor was I angry.]]></report>

One building which I noticed was a large glass enclosed thing with new cars in it. In front a girl, with her back to me, was standing there. She was dressed in a white negligee. This excited me, but when I came closer I noticed that she had cotton and adhesive tape all over her body like they covered sores, so I kept walking.]]></report>

I thought to myself that Paul C. (friend's name) would get arrested. I followed. We were on a very wide highway. It was night, and way up ahead it was very shadowy. I saw the police car go on the right of my friend, and I had a premonition of a wreck, and just then I heard a crash. I then saw my friend's car back out of the middle.]]></report>

They, with the other guests, were drinking beer from copper of pewter mugs. I noticed that beer kept spilling on the bare floor in the corner near a table. For some reason this was rather disturbing, so I went for a walk. The next thing I remember I was walking through a long tunnel. It was like the tunnels that connect the various lines in the large "metro" (subway) stations in Paris. I came out on Euclid Ave. in front of Moe's. I walked around on Euclid and then reentered the tunnel. I returned home to find the party over and the house quiet.]]></report>

A cop came along and shined a flashlight in our eyes. We jumped off the table and out of the garage. (The cop was the short, fat one who guards the Severance Hall parking lot.) He had a large, mostly white dog; maybe a collie. The dog chased us. We climbed over a back fence (with difficulty) and escaped.]]></report>

I was standing with some friends who said that there were several of the enemy in the woods and in the room. (I think the enemy was Nazis or some nationalistically bound group.) We all had cutlasses in our hands. Some enemy approached, and I was told I must kill them or be killed. I started hacking at one with my cutlass. The enemy was a block of wood 10" x 2" x 5'. My blows were very violent, but rather inaccurate. None penetrated more than an inch or two. I finally killed the enemy but was afraid that his companions would kill me. Suddenly a young man dressed in a Tyrolian alpine costume appeared from the room and led me away to safety.]]></report>

As I was going under the effect of the gas, I remember trying to yell out that I should be recognized. There was no one present that I can remember, and I had the feeling that I was suspended in space. There was no sound, and it appeared to me that I had been able to force myself out of the gravity of society, and I was at last on the outside looking in. Everything was at a complete calm until suddenly I was jarred by a loud noise, a high pitched voice that struck me and then disappeared and finally reappeared again, going through the same cycle many times. Then I awoke with a start. While I was unconscious, I seem to remember doughnut shaped forms that kept getting brighter and darker, first the doughnut itself and then the hole seemed to change its brilliance. The light seemed to be self-contained and not reflected.]]></report>

The one I can remember most vividly was a turkey. The girl stopped singing and went over and chased the animals off the stage. I remember I didn't sing the duet very well and was worried about what the girl would say to me after we were finished. We finished the duet, and the audience was as quiet as a tomb; there was absolutely no applause, and we walked off the stage down through the audience amid silence. The dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was at John Adam's football field watching a game. The seats in front of me were vacant, but sitting on my right side was a man and his girlfriend. The thing I remember most about the man was that he was extremely handsome. During the game two friends of mine came in (male) and sat in front of us. The man next to me asked if these two people (both 24) were from John Adams, and I told him they were. He said that it was too bad because John Adams couldn't win the championship because for some reason he didn't give, John Adams was to be disqualified from competition. Here the dream ended.]]></report>

A girl at the meeting seemed to feel guilty or else felt that the implication was directed at her. She related her story. In this story, she told how someone called her. But she didn't say who. How it happened in the dream was that the person who called her was me. Someone asked her who called her. (This someone is unknown in the dream.) She told him. This someone confronted me and accused, implied, or told me. I immediately came to my defense saying that I did call, but for such and such reasons, and that I did stop back at the house, but for a few minutes. This defense in the dream seemed to be a satisfactory defense or story as it seemed to clear me.]]></report>

My father seemed to be trying to turn me against my mother. For a while, I was believing him, and I felt that my mother had done something wrong. Then for some reason, I changed my mind, and I began to dislike my father. I am sure that there was some good reason in the dream for my changing my mind, but I can't remember it. After this, I began to think of my mother's weak heart and how she might die. This was accompanied by a very sad, sympathetic, loving attitude toward my mother. Then I went into my mother's bedroom and noticed the sheets and the pillow were dirty; that is, they were uniformly dark. A sheet would have to be very dirty to be this color. Then I thought what a pity that my poor mother has to sleep in a bed like that, and I had the same feeling described above.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was walking down Euclid Ave. There was a dog closely resembling the dog I mentioned in a previous dream (Brownie). Yet I realized in the dream that Brownie was dead, and that this wasn't the same dog. This dog was lying on his stomach, and when I first approached him, he may have snarled or at least he looked mean or unfriendly. As I began to pet him, he turned over on his side and his back as dogs often will do. Even while I was petting him, I felt that I couldn't trust him completely, and that he might bite me. The dog seemed to enjoy my petting and scratching him. Though I felt he might bite me, the fear of being bitten was very small, but there was a fear. I had a candy bar in my pocket, and as I rose to leave I felt that the dog wanted this candy bar (a Baby Ruth). However, I didn't want to give the dog this candy bar, and then I told him that he couldn't have it. I then left and proceeded west down Euclid Ave. on my way I believe to a typing class which I am now taking at John Hay three nights a week.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I borrowed a book from someone at the co-op whose name I believe was Bernie. Actually I'm not sure of who this Bernie was, but he seemed to be a good friend of mine, and I had a mild superior feeling toward him; that is, I had the feeling that I would always act natural when talking to him, whereas with many of the members of the co-op, I still act somewhat superficial. I was returning the book to this Bernie, and he lived at a two-family house. I rang the upstairs bell, and some male co- op members answered the door. I asked for Bernie, and they told me he lived downstairs. I went downstairs and rang the bell, and when the door opened I found that more co-op fellows were living together downstairs. I was somewhat surprised that they were all living in the same house. I returned the book. I also had the feeling that this Bernie was a small guy of slight build.]]></report>

I saw the ushers -- Sam, Bill, and Frank -- leave me at the side entrance of the church to go to meet their bridesmaids in front of the altar. Now I saw Charlene come down the aisle, with her Dad helping her. I started going to meet her, thinking why did I do it? We went directly to the altar without genuflecting, were married, received communion, and started leaving the church. I thought I heard a fire engine and started running out of the church, but I finally realized it was my alarm clock and woke up.]]></report>

I did not recognize those who attended, outside of a girl who was supposed to be the sister of the girl with whom I was involved (I never did see my girlfriend in the dream at all.) This sister, however, I recognized as being a young widow with whom a friend of mine actually had an affair; I had seen a picture of her a few months before. At any rate, she seemed physically desirable to me in the dream, so I purposely waited until most of the others had gone home or had fallen asleep -- was dimly aware of the fact that the party had worn out its welcome, and the host wanted us to leave (it must have been 3:00 or 4:00). We finally got up to leave; as I was the only one who had a car, I was obliged to take the others home. I intentionally did not take this girl home before I dropped off the others. Then we parked. I placed my arm about her, and noticing the disgusting leer of sheer physical desire on her face, I recalled thinking that I was certainly a dirty rascal intending to make love to this girl merely because her sister (allegedly my true love) was not there.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was an attendant at the mental hospital. I was instructed by a nurse to take a patient down on the elevator to lower floor. Patient, often violent, was lying on a roll-away table (similar to type used in operating rooms). I felt a vague sensation of fear and lack of confidence in my ability to handle the task in event of an emergency, but I agreed to carry out the instructions. We entered the elevator, with me in the elevator was another attendant (not considered dependable by me) and a trustee patient. We began to descend, and I began to wonder what would happen if the bottom fell out of the elevator; suddenly the floor of the elevator opened (similar to the bomb bays in an airplane), and we all fell through. All of us, except the patient, managed to hang onto ledges in the elevator shaft; the other attendant and I were hanging on to the patient at the same time. Both the patient and the trustee were hysterical, shouting, crying, and struggling violently; I remember a definite feeling of disgust, and I thought to myself, isn't this typical of human beings. You can never depend on them for anything -- not even to the extent of making their personal rescue easier.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Herb, a friend of mine, had borrowed my car in order to transport some movie equipment. As he drove the car off, he misjudged the height of a low steel bridge; the car struck the lower part of the bridge, damaging the top of my car quite severely. Angered, I pushed my way into the car and demanded that Herb let me drive. We got underway, but the car behaved in a crazy fashion. It weaved all over the road. The brakes would not work, and there was no pick-up. Driving into the parking lot at home, I noticed several cars parked in front of my garage, so I was unable to park my car (which further irritated me). My sister then approached, glanced at the damage to my car, and began to insist loudly that our parents would not help to pay for the repairs. Angrily, I told her that I didn't expect anybody to help me with the repairs -- that I would pay for them myself.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was taking my girlfriend home on a bicycle; as I didn't know where she lived, I asked her for directions. She said drive straight down Payne Ave. until you come to a dead end, then turn right, go on for a short distance, and then turn left. We speeded down the bumpy road (made even bumpier by the fact that one side of the road was being torn up for repair purposes). We arrived at the dead end near a group of long, shabby looking shacks near the edge of a lake. As it was late at night, I was alarmed when I noticed that the lights were on in her house. I wondered whether or not her parents were waiting up for her. As we approached the front door, I noticed her sister sitting there on the stairs; as my girl friend opened the door, I could see a large group of people inside talking in a low murmur. My girlfriend greeted them cordially and entered, leaving me standing outside. As I had little else to do, I engaged myself in conversation with her sister. An old man came and stood near us silently for a while; then he asked in a friendly manner, who I was. Immediately I introduced myself to him and found then that he was my girlfriend's father.]]></report>

There was a huge, decorated birthday cake in the center of the table. Ever time I counted the candles on the cake they increased in number. Amazed at this, I was told that when one reaches 21, the rest of his life passes quickly, and I shouldn't be surprised at this at all. Even in the dream this did not make sense to me but worried me intensely.]]></report>

Each of these people had a large cloth bag seemed with a drawstring, on the floor next to him. One at a time they would bring forth and/or take something from their sack and make a speech about it. As I remember, the articles included a book, a hat, a pair of socks, and a pipe. The talks were discussions of the characteristics of each article. The speaker would say a few words, and then his companions would tell him to sit down, and another person would start. This procedure was repeated several times. One of the men kept laughing at everything that was said, and finally his companions told him he must stop or else leave. Then a large French door was down in front of the whole scene, and the dream ended there, as looking at a blank wall.]]></report>

However, I was waiting on an elderly woman customer who couldn't make up her mind what kind of drapes she wanted to buy. She kept taking up my time all afternoon, so that I was unable to go to lunch at all. Finally I became so irate that I became very antagonistic toward the woman. She informed the supervisor, and he told me to be more courteous and wait on the lady. Finally she decided on the purchase, paid me, and left. The currency she paid me looked rather suspicious to me at the time, but I angrily went on about business. When the cash register was checked at the end of the day, the bills were found to be counterfeit. For some illogical reason the supervisor said that he was going to call the police to have me arrested.]]></report>

There was a kind of mechanical contrivance which resembled a bicycle, which I crawled around and through. I became partially entangled in it, then escaped. Then I got on a very tiny railroad handcar no larger than a toy and began to pump furiously. Somehow it was large enough to hold me, but I got nowhere. The track took me right back to where I had started. Then I had a feeling of having made my escape and was sneaking off through the dark. I went out through a window in the garage.

			<report><![CDATA[I was seated in the living room of a girl (19) who has slept with me in the past. A friend of mine (m, 20) was there as were the girl's parents. I next found myself seated at the dinner table with the girl and another man (22) who was blackballed two semesters ago from my fraternity. I found myself cutting and heating his hand, instead of the food which was on my plate. I was impressed that he felt no pain. After dinner, we returned to the living room and then left her parents there and went to her bedroom. As we were going to bed, I noticed my friend coming into the room. I took a shot at him with a gun I found by the bedside. Suddenly this other man (the one who had been blackballed) leaped into the room and attacked me with a knife. I was terrified.]]></report>

(I had that feeling and the men in the car were warmly and roughly dressed.) I was standing at the entrance to the car watching a group of the above-mentioned men eating at one of the tables. A drunk staggered down the aisle and began an argument with one of the men. A fight was narrowly averted and the next thing I knew was that a huge blond man was standing at the opposite door of the car and hurling baseballs with tremendous force at us. (We were covering on the floor.) I was not hit but was terrified.]]></report>

It is covered by a complex of tangle and wooden structure and is of infinite depth. I am not too anxious to climb on this wooden frame but feel as though I must or lose the admiration of my friend. (I have no idea who he is.) As I climb around I realize that one false move and I'm cooked. Sure enough, I slip and almost fall into the dark depths but something, somewhere, somehow, saves me. I remember feeling a sensation in my genitals as I am about to fall (falling actually does produce a sensation as does most motion through space). It is accompanied by a vacuum feeling in the throat.]]></report>

Some character walked toward us, and just as he approached, pointed to the corridor of a house (the second story). He said it will only cost you two bucks. We saw at the window sill a long haired brunette with her elbows leaning on the window sill. Her breasts hung loosely and she appeared to be very sexy. I laughed and said not for me. I walked away leaving my two buddies gaping at the window. They were roaring with laughter as they entered the house (I think).]]></report>

It was to set off an atomic ray which would make the bombs ineffective. I reached for the switch and at the same time heard the roar of the planes.

We all sat down and indulged in various activities some listened to the radio, others danced, while still others just sat and had something to drink.

However, about two weeks ago I had a misunderstanding with her and the situation remains somewhat tense. In the dream this girl seems to question me about trivial things that I can't recall. Then the other girls enters but says very little. The boy enters and he also remains quite untalkative. This girl and boy then sit down and listen to the first girl question me. Finally, I take the girl by the hand, but she still continues to quiz me.]]></report>

Whenever I tried to question him he gave me evasive answers about himself. Finally this man said that he was going to take over our home and our family must comply with his wishes.

I was I at the window for the purpose of telling my sister (27) who was on the opposite street (3 floors below) something which I cannot recall. However, I shook my head from side to side but my sister did not understand that I meant no to whatever matter was concerned. Whereupon I lifted the window, which was already partly open, to shout the answer and thus be understood. On the ledge (outer ledge) of the aperture were two handbags one of which (a green one) I recognizes as my sister's.

When I asked about the money he was willing to lend it to me (about $1,500) for a couple of months at 50% interest. I felt very outraged or rather unbelieving.

The smaller base was on the top and it was the part which I was continually trying to fasten.

While I was waiting for them to come out I watched some colored people play a hide and seek game -- one would hide behind a pillar and the other would try to find him. After I had walked down the street quite a ways the thought came to me that I had lost my aunt and mother because I didn't get back in time to meet them where I had said I would. Later I finally did meet them. They looked as if they had gone to the hairdresser's and gotten new hairdos. told them that they looked great and that there appearances had changed. My mother told me that the hairdo's hadn't changed their appearances. When I got up close to them I agreed with her. My mother had on a cheap skimpy dress that I thought I could almost see through. I thought that I almost could see her cunt. When that thought went through my mind I thought jokingly that it was an incestuous idea. I noticed that there was hair on her leg. I didn't feel proud of her.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A group of boys my age and I were playing on a large field. I suggested that we play horse and rider. Some said yes that's a good game. Then a whole lot of girls my age came onto the field. I suggested the same game again and everybody took up the suggestion. The field later turned into a dance floor. I danced with one girl and we were really enjoying ourselves. While we were dancing someone put on a record that was hard to dance to. She told me that she would like to sit this one out. The guy who was taking care of the records explained to us that he put on the wrong record by mistake. I then went behind the bar. I suggested that I go over and bring back a bulletin that stated Mr. Hall was a communist.]]></report>

One guy told me we were going over to my roommate's house to eat. I said, "Do they serve meals?" Then I remembered that they had the best meals in town. I was in a car riding through a forest. With me there a few other guys my age. We saw a bear along side of the river which ran close to the road. I said look at the bear, It was probably washed up by the flood. Went on further, and I saw a pheasant. I said look at that pheasant and what's that behind it? It looks like a chicken hawk. The chicken hawk was sneaking up on the pheasant. As we went on I saw more pheasants. Before we got on to the main road leading to town, we stopped the car in order that some of the guys could get completely dressed. It irritated me that they didn't finish dressing before we left the house to go to eat.]]></report>

We went fishing by tying strings around our finger and used pickles as bait. I caught a large catfish. The hicks told us the fishing was good because they made pickles and stored them in their basement which was in the water. The fish were attracted by the smell or flavor of the pickles and always stayed near the house.]]></report>

I got on my bike and began riding at the end of the group. We rode across the bridge and up a narrow path which wound around a small conical shaped mountain. As we rode I noticed the water which had been in the river was rising upward as we rose higher and had changed into an ocean surrounding the mountain or pinnacle. No fears or emotions seemed to accompany this strange phenomena.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing on one bank of a river looking at a structure on the other side. The structure was in the general shape of a barn, but was of a light cream color and of a modern design. Suddenly I was on the barn side of the river and was watching a little girl who had swallowed a nail. (Her body and features were that of a small girl, but somehow she seemed to be older.) Her brother was there and was going to use a small suction pump to remove the nail from her stomach. He attached the suction pump on her mouth and played an organ while the pump was working. (I was not conscious of any sounds however.) The little girl fainted (or something similar) and the nail fell to the ground. (We were standing ankle deep in water all this time.) I was shocked when the nail fell into the water onto the ground and I stared at the nail for some time.]]></report>

I raked over the coals with a long pool bridge to see if I could start a fire. (Had played pool recently). The fire started and began to flame very high (was not conscious of heat). Flames were somewhat confined by cardboard which didn't seem to burn. When flames reached ceiling we looked for fire extinguisher. Male companion get extinguisher which was hanging up in rafters; got it by climbing up in rafters; handed it down to me (hose type extinguisher). Extinguisher was leaking fluid and we weren't sure we could use it to put out fire. Was not panicky due to fire; didn't seem important after we got the extinguisher.]]></report>

As I walked I picked up heavy sticks until in my right hand I carried a large knife and five sticks. We crossed several individuals who looked as if they wanted a fight. We met a group of boy scouts (men of all ages) and passed them. Suddenly I seemed to realize that, the boy scouts were actually enemy soldiers invading us. I rushed back, alone, to warn our army and found that they had surrounded the enemy. We were on a group of hills around the enemy in the plain. I took a gun and started to shoot. The countryside turned into a large machine like a tank. We were on a raised portion of it and the enemy were sitting in a large section in the middle of it. After we had fired at them, we jumped down and to our surprise were captured by the enemy who were still alive. Then as an onlooker I watched loaded airplanes fly out of the machine to attack the country.]]></report>

I was going to sleep with the girl that night while my frat brother kept guard. Then the scene switched. Instead of sleeping in the basement we were going to sleep in a cabin on top of a 30 foot pole in the middle of a field. (The field was one in which I played football as a young child.) We climbed up a large ladder, carrying blankets to the cabin. Several other people were on the ground, watching (strangers).

I looked up in the sky and saw a meteor or comet coming closer and closer. I ran into a garage and lay on the floor of the garage. There was a mechanic and 2 or 3 other men there. I yelled at them that the end was here but they only said we know, we know and did nothing. They seemed very blase.]]></report>

As a matter of fact it's about the only paste they don't stock, she tells me. Why? She takes a tube of paste, presses it, but the paste doesn't come out of the usual orifice but from a cut in the tube (as one sometimes finds with an old tube). This is indicative of the trouble they've been having with Ipana. I can't remember whether I finally purchased a tube of paste.]]></report>

The student apologized saying he thought the class had already been adjourned. Later, assignment sheets were handed out. Mine consisted of an envelope containing a children's shoe.

Among all the people I can only identify one, an Israeli about 40 years old whom I once knew. I soon found out I was on a boat -- a boat docked in the harbor oil Jaija, Israel. I go up on deck and find out that the Israel-Arab war is starting. I then see many disconnected war scenes from the Israel war, the blowing up of a bridge north of Haija, a naval battle off Haija with the Egyptians, etc. I am quite excited and I fly around the boat and around the bay area in order to get a better view of the naval battle. It seems that there are many middle aged women on the boat who are also quite excited.]]></report>

I looked carefully at the negro and decided that he wasn't actually Robeson and that they in their excitement had mistaken some other person for the singer. Suddenly the reporters changed into armed guards with browning automatics. Another person in another part of the room got up and started to make for the door. They brutally shot him down. Sadistically standing over him, and machine gunning him after he, was dead. 1 got excited and yelled out you could blooded bastards and the audience which during the shooting had not even turned their heads from the performance, looked at me coldly.]]></report>

I went to get her a glass of water, and when I opened the cabinet the door I slammed back making a loud noise. I seemed unable to control my hands or motions. When I turned on the water it came pouring out. Then I dropped the glass with a loud smash. My hands had either too much strength, or too little strength. I could sense the feeling of disgust that the people in the room must have felt toward me. I remember feeling disgusted with myself.]]></report>

The man gets very mad, and takes out of a box a long, black, horrible snake. The snake appears to be almost human in intelligence and rationalization. Berle is extremely afraid of the snake. The man goes but he leaves the snake behind him. Every time Berlie makes a move, the snake watches him with apprehensive eyes. The snake then began to purposely annoy Berle in an almost human fashion. It would crawl toward Berle in a sort of motion, Berle would be very frightened and run and jump all over the furniture. While running he would be frantically holding on to the mike. He would be continually trying to continue the show in a horribly frightened way. It was sheer frustration at its utmost.

All of a sudden, two large boats came into the picture and I tried to go around them. Then everything turned into large boats in a sort of a maze. At first they were all friendly toward each other, and then the first two large boats became hostile over something. I tried to tell the captain of the first boat something helpful about the other boat, but he refused to listen. I had a feeling of disgust and anger, and turned to join sides with the other boat. I was refused here also, but another man who resembled a casual friend of mine was welcomed aboard. He laughed loudly and boarded the ship.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was staring at a football when for some reason it turned into a sheep. It was a full size sheep with a sheep's body, but its neck was made of the lace of a football. The lace, however, had been bent, as often is the lace of a football, and the sheep's head seemed to be too heavy' for the bent lace. In the dream I loved the sheep and would continually hold it and pet it. As long as I held the sheep and loved it, the lace neck held up the head. When I stopped holding it, the head would fall down again. I had the feeling of being quite worried about the poor bent neck and a fear of letting it go because the head would fall off. I wanted very much to do something about it, and felt very bad when I couldn't.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I own a new Chevrolet. I drove it around the corner and then parked it near by a house I lived in 10 years ago. When I came back, I discovered the car was missing. I then realized I had forgotten to remove the key. After a while I went to the house I used to live in. It was a double house and I knew the people who lived downstairs. I asked her if she knew anything about the car. She didn't. As I was leaving, the lady upstairs called to me and told me the police were holding t he car and it would cost $70 to regain the car from the police.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My roommate and I lived together in an old one-roomed house. The house was very comfortable, though, inside. The area at this place was very remote as far as neighbors were concerned, but there are trees and streams there. Our house was located where an old dynamite shed is located (in the real setting). I was a little provoked at my roommate's messy habits of leaving everything lying around in a chaotic manner. Despite this I was happy to remain there. Finally my roommate decided to leave because it was so desolate. I should have been sorry to see him go, but I felt glad to be left alone in this small house. I remember that it was hard to get to and from this place, because of a marshy area that had to be crossed. After my roommate left, I took life easy and actually was very happy loafing. Then people began to come back to see me, children mostly. They wanted to see how I was. I felt that I was obliged to entertain these people's curious desire to see me and even was glad when they came, but I began to feel as though I was separating from society, turning into an oddity.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My mother gave me some christmas cards and other articles to deliver to our neighbors. It seems that some of the cards had been delivered to our house by mistake. I started out and delivered them to the various houses, which were all familiar, but the people didn't seem to be anyone whom I knew. It was snowing out and I remember that I wasn't too happy about the weather. After delivering the last letter or package, I'm not sure which it was, I had a golf club left and no one to take it to. Therefore I began walking toward town; here an automobile pulled up beside me and I began talking to the man, who was no one I recognized, about golf and the activities of the country club. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was on the golf course watching the golfers. It was a happy feeling, no responsibility, and I seemed to be in my element. Then I went up to the club house. The club house seemed fascinating to me, just like It did when I was bout 6 years old, and I enjoyed being around it as if it were some sort of pleasure which I haven't felt for years. Then I went into the club house and my brother was playing the slot machines, which I disapprove of. However, when I entered, he had a great stroke of luck and money (nickels) was coming from every one he played. We filled our pockets and then left.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[A friend of mine introduced me to this girl who had a very sexy appearance. Immediately I managed to get a date with the girl for that evening at 8. The situation was very pleasing. I made arrangements for my transportation, money and everything else. A friend was going to lend me his car, which would be parked around the corner from the Daily Times (our local newspaper office). At about 20 to 8, I started to go to pick the girl up. This gave me plenty of time. However, I stopped at the pool room and ended up talking to the proprietor, whom I know quite well. All the time I knew that I had this date, but I kept on talking with various friends whom I met there. I now wanted to leave as it was 5 till 8. I had the girl's. telephone number and had to call her to find out out how to get to her house, as I had forgotten by that time. I tried to dial her number which I had on a piece of paper, but I kept making blunders. I couldn't seem to dial the number correctly, though I tried numerous times. This became very frustrating. I decided to start out and stop off on the way to call, because I knew in what section she lived. Yet knowing this I started out in the opposite direction. I stooped to call again with no better results. My moves were clumsy and finally it was 9 and too late to get her so I had to give the venture up because here the dream ended. I wanted to take the girl for sensual reasons, but my body actions seemed to be competing against me.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was, living here in Cleveland in a fraternity house, but it was located in a downtown section. My fraternity brothers were fellows I used to know back home except one who I remember as being a fellow I know from Cleveland. I was upstairs cleaning up around. Then I came downstairs and found a lot of colored people there. Right away I noticed they had lipstick on, and this struck me as being peculiar. I couldn't help staring; once when I noticed that I was watching them, they attempted to hide their faces, some did at least. There were a bunch of dogs with them also. The dogs had fleas or something and were spreading an epidemic of disease in the neighborhood. I realized that I had to get serum to stop the epidemic. I didn't know where to get the serum. I had no transportation and went back to the fraternity house, but no one had any transportation. One fellow lent me his bicycle, so I started. I went about one block and saw a buddy of mine driving a bus, so I laid my bicycle down and asked him to take me. He said he couldn't, so I went back to get the bicycle and someone had stolen it. Finally another friend came by in a car and I got in. We started off.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[This dream took place in back of my home. I was in the army and defending the area against the Japanese, or some Asian group. There were six or seven other soldiers with me, and I remember several of them were my friends here at school. I went out into the field before me which extended about 40 yards before the ground level rises to form a hill. It seems that the enemy was located on the other side of the hill. I was very frightened, in a feeling of helplessness more than real fear. I no sooner started out than I could see the enemy beginning to advance. I quickly went back to the rest of the group to stand off the attack. I took my rifle and began shooting at the enemy. I shot them with no effect and I found that I had not taken the safety off the gun. Now I was out of ammunition, as I borrowed some from the soldiers around me. Now when I shot, the advancing enemy would be killed. The other soldiers now seemed to be doing very little and I was defending the whole group. The enemy soldiers would almost get to me and I would kill them. I had no moral compunctions about killing them, but a feeling of to kill or be killed, along with a feeling that they were making me kill them. Finally I had killed enough so that the remainder retreated. As soon as the enemy retreated, three men came up to me and said to one another, "this is the one," pinning a medal on me. I felt good but that turned to fear, like now every one of the enemy would be out to get me. Our group then retreated back to our house. A new group of the enemy attacked from the rear, but I saw them soon enough to give warning and avert a surprise attack. At this point I killed a man with my bare hands (a knife that is). This being the first time I had ever done anything like this. I viewed his body afterwards, and felt no pity whatsoever. Then the dream changed into some other theme.]]></report>

I cannot remember which of my fraternity brothers it was, however as we were walking along, in a rather silly mood, a large woman of 55 approached us from the opposite direction. She was wearing high heels and a brown suit, the jacket of which appeared too small for her enormous bust line. She had deep lines in her forehead and around her mouth and wore too much make up. This friend and I both saw her simultaneously and let out a giggle. We felt embarrassed. I did anyway, and hurried past her to look back and begin laughing once again. There were many people on the sidewalks. The next instant I was at my girl's apartment sitting next to her on a sofa. I exclaim, "Oh honey. You should have seen the enormous woman I saw today." There was no color.]]></report>

He started to cry and I picked him up to soothe him. His parents came up and I paid them for the dental work that I guessed had to be done (there probably would be none, but I still gave them money). Later I found out that one of my front teeth was loosened and would have to be removed. My aunt (30) and uncle (33) came with me to a dentist and it was done.]]></report>

A small child had drowned and police had just brought the child to the surface of the water. The child was wrapped in a large blue blanket. As my friend and I stood on the bridge and watched, Dr. Boone's two little girls came to identify the child. They waded into the water and unwrapped the dead child. Mrs. Boone appeared on the bank in a red two-piece dress and told her girls not to look at the child too long because they might cry. My friend and I laughed and threw the two Boone children candy. Then we found out that the drowned child was my friend's brother who died 18 years ago. We decided not to tell his mother and then left.]]></report>

Then some women came running out of the house crying, "Call the fire department." Just then a fire truck rolled up and the firemen began to put out the fire. I don't remember them using any fire equipment other than the truck, but the fire was soon out and the house showed no signs of damage. The old man disappeared and the women who came out of the house invited me in and said it surely was a good thing I happened to be passing by.]]></report>

My finger was sore so I tied a string around it in order to see it more clearly. Then I saw what I thought was a very short hair right under the surface of the skin of my finger. I tried to pull it out but it began to more and went through my hand, up my arm and to my shoulder. As it began to move I saw that it had an illuminous head. this particular night it was my turn to help with the supper dishes of the frat house. I told one of the boys I would have to wash the dishes then because I had to see a doctor about the thing in my finger. We walked out into the backyard which looked like a desert. There were dishes on all sides that had to be washed but none were dirty. After a short while I got the dishes washed, borrowed a red bicycle and left for the doctor's office.]]></report>

Several times during the dream I took off from the sidewalk and ascended to the height of a house. After circling around the street I would land safely and try again. Although I never fell, I was worried that the "wings" would fail me once in the air. Above the street was a mass of telephone wires, communication wires, and electric streetcar wires. In flying up from the sidewalk I had to get through all these wires and was therefore extremely anxious that I would become entangled.

			<report><![CDATA[My buddy (age 25, male) and I went to a pier on a lake or ocean. My buddy got into a boat with another person and rowed away from the pier. I attached a piece of shrimp to some fishing tackle and threw the line over the edge of the pier. Almost immediately I caught a large fish about 5 feet long and had to struggle hard to bring it in. Since I seldom fish and do not like the sport, I was exceedingly pleased with my accomplishment. Although I thought the fish was dead, it was only pretending. I carried the fish to a shack at the end of the pier, but it had turned into a bear and was alive. The bear was preparing to attack me and I picked up a pen knife and started plunging it into his body. Finally, I subdued the animal by puncturing his heart (red blood gushed out). I felt sad, however, because the bear skin was so full of holes that it couldn't be used for a coat.]]></report>

It seemed that a party was going on, but only a few couples were there. They were dancing near the door which we had come in. On the other side of the room was a raised platform with chairs arranged in a semicircle for a symphony orchestra. A few of the chairs were occupied. My friend began to play classical music on the piano picking out each note slowly. I was surprised because he had never played classics before. At the foot of the piano was a basket filled with uncooked pieces of meat. I began picking up hams and roasts and then putting them back in the basket.]]></report>

On each plate was a pile of potatoes about three feet high and I imagined that these potatoes were made from the insides of snakes. I then saw an automobile coming down the street and wondered how it would get past the table. The scene then changed. My car was parked in a vacant field and I had lost the keys. I spent a long time looking for the keys but never found them. I then noticed that both of the rear tires were flat. I fixed the tires, but my father ridiculed me since I didn't have any keys to operate the car. Again the scene changed. I was in Korea operating a side show. My act involved the use of two serpents. I would twist and contort one of the serpents while the other rested. I would then repeat the act with the other serpent.]]></report>

At the start of the dream I was standing alone on a wooded hillside. The area seemed to have been burned over and stumps of trees dotted the landscape. Suddenly a wild boar appeared on the scene. Its face was generalized, but the white tusks showed. The boar started chasing me and I ran for dear life. As I ran the tusks moved closer and I was sure that I would be gored. With the boar at my heels I barely managed to get behind a tree and my heart felt as if it was going to stop from fright. At the side of the wood I noticed a piece of machinery with a flat surface and a vertical saw. The boar climbed up on the machine and was sawed in half. An elephant then appeared and swallowed the boar whole like a snake. The elephant then stretched out its legs and I woke up.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I found myself driving my car. I was leaving the neighborhood where a girl with whom I used to have dates (five years ago) lives. As I was turning the corner, I cut too sharply and ran into an old lady who was waiting at the curb for a bus. I backed up hurriedly, turned around on the front lawn of the closest house knocking down several little fences bordering the walk, and drove away from the scene. I later found myself in the garage at my mother's home. I was examining the inner-tube from the car and found that it had about six pair of evenly spaced nails in its side and each was completely forced into the tube to the head. Later I remember looking at the motor and found it to be a mess covered with heavy oil and grease. I was later pouring water into the opening for oil. I discovered my mistake and stopped pouring. At this point the dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in a small classroom with some students from my chemistry section; however the class seemed to be in French. We were given forms to be filled out for a student who was majoring in psychology. They were obviously a part of an experiment or project. We were to fill out these forms with the first thing that came to our minds, and we were working against a few-minute time limit. I couldn't think of a thing to write. Even after everyone turned his form in I still had mine and tried to fill it out but with little success. The words that I did put down didn't seem to form sentences and they were all simple words like cat, it, etc. The professor seemed to be one of the male faculty of the WRU romance languages department who I had met once but who had never been one of my professors. One girl of the class was very outstanding in my mind. The rest of the class I couldn't recognize, but I assumed they were in my chemistry section due to the presence of the girl. That girl wore large shining glasses.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In the first part of the dream I was in a men's clothing store in my hometown looking for a rain coat. The only rain coat the salesman was able to show me was one made of woven straw and with isinglass panels on the upper part of the sleeves. I didn't buy the coat because both of the panels were cracked and I could image that the coat wouldn't last long. However, the price tempted me since it was only $5.30. The salesman began to tell me about his boss who was very disagreeable, tight and whenever he spoke the whole store smelled like sauerkraut. His boss broke up our conversation and I left the store. After I left I met most of the members of the Reserve football team. We walked down the street together until we came to an intersection. On the opposite corner was Harry Truman and in the adjacent corner was a friendly policeman. The football players couldn't catch the ball. I could. President Truman reported the friendly policeman to the chief of police for not staying on duty. We were all very disgusted.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The dream occurred just before waking this morning and was one of a series of short dreams. This was the most complete and best-remembered however. I am at home and it is 1:30, which is the time the mail is delivered. I ran down to the mailbox and a letter from the Reserve medical school. I close my eyes, say a few magic words and proceed to open it. It isn't an acceptance, however, but a letter saying that because I've had so many doctors write recommendations for me the money ($5) I paid originally for applying didn't cover the cost of handling all the letters I had had sent. Consequently my chances of getting into medical school were much smaller than previously. The next day I saw the dean of the school, and he further elaborated what I had seen in the letter. He seemed very disgusted with me and my methods. He also said that they had little respect for fellows who tried to swamp with "too good" letters of recommendations. Here, thank god, I awoke.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I, the dreamer, approached Mr. Harry Schenk, an instructor in the physics dept. to ask him to fill out another recommendation for medical school for me. However, he reached out his hand as if to contratulate me at the same time he reached into his vest pocket, which I have never known him to wear in reality. He pulled out a letter with my name on it. When I read it I found that an international physics and chemistry society had awarded me a scholarship for the coming year if I would in spare time aid by teaching lab work in the physics and chemistry depts. Naturally, I was very astonished but quite eager about the whole affair and accepted it at once. For the rest of the day I received congratulations from all of the science teachers that I have ever had or have known indirectly. The day was wonderful and I realized that this all would aid me tremendously in getting into medical school.]]></report>

I am captured and imprisoned somewhere in Germany. I escape and most of the dream consists of my eluding the Germans, trying to use my one year of German effectively. Among the escapades, I resort to wounding my face with a piece of glass so as to disfigure my face making me unrecognizable. I come back to America in the uniform of a German soldier who I killed to get his clothes and paper (America is conquered). Here I act as the soldier and am able to reside at home where I try to help my family and aid the underground.]]></report>

The procession was led by Dr. Millis and all the major theological leaders of town. We all wore white robes and marched down Euclid Ave. in a formation resembling a large cross. We met at Adelbert Rd. and Euclid at 4 in the morning and were to arrive at he stadium about 12 noon. We had a good time on the way telling jokes and kidding. When we reached the stadium, it was bounded by three churches, Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant. We ate the lunches that we had packed and then we listened to very interesting speeches by prominent theologians and the presidents of the colleges. Afterwards we came back in trucks and slept the rest of the afternoon. Of the speeches the best was given by a young intelligent looking priest. (I am protestant.)]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The dream started off in the living room of a large mansion with four people whom I did not recognize standing looking at a package they had received in the mail. The package contained a music box inside of which was a calling card of a local undertaker. Suddenly we were aware that someone had been killed in the next room although we didn't see the body. A detective was called in to start the investigation in a typical Sherlock Holmes style. Everyone there was questioned including the undertaker who turns out to be a close friend of the family. After much thought the detective accuses the undertaker who in turn breaks down and confesses that business was so bad that he killed the person and then sent the music box as advertisement so the family would give him the business. The people in the room seemed to be my family but did not actually resemble my family in any way. The parents were about 40 years old and the daughter and son about 22. Even there was a feeling of some relationship. I still felt most of the time that I was merely a spectator.]]></report>

Yet the frat house looked like one that is pieture in the movies. In reality and in the dream Dave Katz was dating a girl who I was very serious about. Dave was leaving the house, thanking me for the weekend and driving away still not knowing who I am and my relationship to the girl. [Note: the strange part about it was that in the dream his build, hair, large nose, etc., were quite distinct and accurate despite the fact that I have never met this fellow, seen his picture, or heard anything about him other than his name.]]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was with two other friends both male and we were all coming out of Gruber's Bar when I saw a red Jaguar parked by the road. I informed my friends that I could start it so why didn't we take it. So we did but not with malice, but more as a thrill. I then became aware of the fact that there was only room for four to sit in the car. (A real Jaguar only has room for two but this had a rumble seat.) This then meant to me that if we picked up some girls there would not be enough romo in the car. The next thing I recall is that there were only two of us in the car, the driver and myself.]]></report>

There was another boy in the bathroom who was also washing. (This bathroom went with our room.) Suddenly a woman materialized in the bathroom beside me. I dropped the soap in the washbowl and splashed her slightly. I apologized for my carelessness. As I was leaving I noticed that all she had on was a thin nightgown. I diverted my gaze from her because I was embarrassed at her dress and also because I had splashed her. I got into what had been my bedroom. It was filled with beds in which were young boys about 10 or 11 altogether. The dream ended.]]></report>

There seemed to be two different types of turtles, land and sea. I asked Bob to stop the car so I could catch some of them to take home. They were very large, about a foot and a half in diameter. I caught two and put them in the trunk of the car. Then I went after some more, but when I came back to the car the two I had put in the car were dead and I was very disappointed because they seemed to be so completely dead.]]></report>

As the plane was about to crash, I was transposed to the deck of the carrier. The body was compressed into a jet tube. However I didn't recognize the body as my own.

He refused to do so either because of a dislike for me because I had turned out better than his own son or because of a previous argument which he had had with my father. He claimed that he couldn't help me because I had had an intimate sexual relationship with my girl. At first I wasn't sure whether I had done this or not. Later I realized I had, but it seemed very conclusive and important that she was not pregnant as a result of it. I was then awaiting the actual trial and again pleaded with him for help.

When my roommate and I entered the bedroom we found two other couples there. They had the room all messed up. The two girls were lying in bed. We told them we would try to repair the television set so that they could see a good picture. In the meantime, the people with whom we had gone to the picnic were waiting in the car.

			<report><![CDATA[This dream took place in a school building. I had many problems on my mind. I was trying to decide what subjects to take in my senior year. A geography teacher became very friendly with me so I decided it would be a good idea to take geography. As I was walking through the hall I heard some people talking about a dance that was coming up. I was worried because I did not have a date. This dance was to be held on New Year's Eve. Then I decided that I might take out the geography teacher. She was a very beautiful woman and relatively young.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was swimming in a pool that I had frequented this summer. There were a great many girls swimming too and when I looked at them I noticed they didn't have any bathing suits on. I went underneath the water and one of the girls followed me and there was a bed on the bottom of the pool. After I had satisfied myself with one girl another came down to the bottom of the pool. This went on for a long time until I could no longer stay underneath the water. I started to dry myself after leaving the water and all the girls gathered around and blew hot air on me until I was dry. It was a wonderful sensation and I lay down on the grass and all the girls surrounded me and started to sing softly in my ears while they stroked my body with soft, gentle hands.]]></report>

I stopped the car and we all got out and I picked up a small rifle and went looking for some animals. A big tiger came charging through the brush and tried to attack the children. I picked up my rifle and shot it through the head. The children looked at me with admiration and I felt happy. It was a bright sunny day and through the trees I saw two deer drinking from a pond. I shot both deer and loaded them on the car and then the children got out and I gave them each a deer. As I drove off the children threw kisses and I was happy and excited.]]></report>

An older woman came over to me and tried to help me up. I became very frightened and didn't want her to touch me. I tried to struggle against her picking me up but I only fell down again. Another woman and then a whole flock of people came over and tried to help me. They lifted me up and started to carry me like they do a baseball player after knocking down the game winning run. I started to feel better but then I broke away from them and started to run. Nobody seemed to chase me and I slowed down to a walk but then I didn't know where I was walking to and I became afraid and it was dark all around me so I couldn't see.]]></report>

I stopped the car in front of the nicest looking house of all and rang the bell not quite knowing what to expect. The most gorgeous girl in the world answered the bell and threw herself in my arms. She was ravishingly beautiful. We got into the car and drove till we reached a large hotel and then we were dancing in a large ballroom. I felt as though we were dancing on clouds and all the people in the room looked at us with jealousy. Then the people disappeared and we were alone in my bedroom. We were both undressed and looked quite older. We were married and spending our first night together. I was extremely happy and the girl said she was happy too.]]></report>

It was about seven in the evening and starting to get dark and I thought people were staring at me from behind closed windows and doors. There was an unnatural quiet in the air and the only sound I could hear were my shoes scraping the cement. All of a sudden a shuttered window opened and a gorgeous girl, unclothed, beckoned to me. I wanted to run into the house where she was staying, but something was preventing me. My feet just couldn't move because all the people were shouting and calling me names. They told me not to go. The girl was pretty and I wanted to go with her very badly but my feet could not move.]]></report>

We became frightened and ran to a house and asked to be taken in. A young boy about 12 was the only person at home, but he let us in. As soon as we got inside, the negro came to the door and attempted to come in. The door was locked, however, and he remained outside. It grew very dark and I looked out the window and saw the negro glaring at me. I thumbed my nose at him and he ran after another small boy who was passing by, caught him and put him into the trunk of a blue 1947 Chrysler. I called the police, but when I looked back to the street the negro had driven away. At this point I awoke.]]></report>

My girlfriend came into the gym. Though I was surprised to see her (for this was the boys' gym) I asked if she would like some instruction in golf. She replied that she would like to learn the game. I gave her a golf club and showed her how to swing. After she had hit nine or ten balls she said that I had better start practicing myself if I wanted to make the golf team. When I began again a boy came over to me and asked me to hit a lead golf ball. I replied that I would not for it might break the club. Then Eddie came over to me and told me to leave for the baseball players had to practice. I was very disappointed but nevertheless I picked up my clubs and left. I then awoke feeling very sad.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had just finished my lunch at home and was riding a red bicycle back to Shaker Heights High School. As I rode along Lee Road, I noticed how dark the sky was becoming. Large gray clouds completely obscured the sun that had been shining a few minutes before. I knew I must hurry for it would rain very soon. Upon reaching the school I parked my bike and hurried to my English class. The entire class was present and only my chair in the front row was vacant. As I entered the classroom I had a strange feeling that I had been absent from this class for a great length of time. Yet no one seemed to be surprised at my arrival. In fact no one in the entire room said a word to me. The class consisted of both my high school and college friends, but I was puzzled and disappointed that my girlfriend was not present.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I had been standing in my bedroom all day watching the peculiar actions of a blimp. It would fly back and forth over the house and disappear for a few minutes. It remained rather high in the air until the afternoon. Then gray clouds began to form in the horizon and the blimp came lower and lower. I put on my pea jacket and reached the backyard just in time to see the silvery blimp land in a field that adjoins our home. I was absolutely amazed. Why should a blimp land here? A small door in the gondola opened and two crew members climbed out. They wore navy uniforms. Suddenly I noticed one of my fraternity brothers (who is a clown and not a very good student) running over to the man who appeared to be in charge. My fraternity brother assured him that it was permissible to moor the blimp in the field for as long as he desired. The captain of the blimp said he must leave soon. My fraternity brother was disappointed for he wanted to use the blimp for an air force demonstration at school.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I found myself attending college in Japan during the second World War. Actually it was Western Reserve University and the setting and surroundings were the same as they are in Cleveland today. My parents had informed me that at a certain hour and a certain day, the university was to be bombed by American planes. I was told to take all possible precautions and to leave the university at once secretly. Furthermore I was to tell a certain girl about this future bombing. I managed to find the girl and informed her and her parents of the air raid. Then eating in the cafeteria a fraternity brother of mine took the last bottle of milk from the counter. He would not share it with me so I vowed not to tell him of the forthcoming raid. In the cafeteria I saw another girl (whom I have just recently met) and I felt that I should warn her also. She put her tray down next to mine but then before I could say anything she had vanished.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I and a young lady of my age, along with another couple who are our age, seemed to be skiing. My date and I tested a long ski run. It seemed to be a long wooden sliding board though. We didn't have skis either. The ride down the board consisted of a slide, then one ski jump, then some more sliding, and finally before the bottom was reached there was a place which caused the slider to think that he was about to do another ski jump but instead, just as he reached the end of the take off platform he would suddenly feel that he was going to fall a huge distance and possibly get hurt or even killed. However, as he continued to go over the end he would actually safely continue a slide to the bottom of the run. All of this procedure was in a sitting position. My date and I tried out the ski run a few times and then proceeded to enjoy watching the anxiety created in the other couple by the trick spot in the run as they attempted it their first time. All four of us laughed then and then proceeded to enjoy having our stomachs come up into our mouths each time we slid down the exciting run.]]></report>

There were two people and one of them seemed to be a friend of mine (who actually lives across the hall from me in my dormitory). I couldn't figure out who the other person was, although he seemed to be an apprentice in the act which the former was performing. He was attempting to play some sort of practical joke. I could hear him opening my dresser drawers. I began to get slightly angry and tried to wake myself up completely. I strained hard, trying to wake myself up. At this point, I really woke up and found that my roommate had just gotten up to go to class. He was opening one of the drawers on his own dresser.]]></report>

I was sort of curious too, as intercourse with my mother was something new and unusual. She consented although she did not become sexually aroused at all. I felt guilty and a bit disgusted during the act. We tried some postural positions which I knew that most women object to, but which I wanted to find out about. The experience was not very pleasurable in general, although I almost had an orgasm immediately before I woke up. Incidentally, no thought of my father occurred to me in this dream although earlier this same night I had a dream in which my father appeared. The dream seemed to be pleasant, but I can't remember what it was about.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was fully clad in a black cowboy suit. I was practicing paddling a canoe on some rapids. It seemed that a certain angle which I turned the canoe allowed it to drift upstream against the swift current, with no paddling required. A large snake was constructively criticizing my efforts which seemed rather successful. I watched the snake swim around a bit with its head raised out of the water. It seemed to wait on the shore downstream, behind me then as I made each trial with the canoe. I seemed to be a bit afraid of the snake, although I respected and heeded its advice. It seemed to be friendly, but I was still slightly afraid of it since it was a rather large snake. I woke up after several successful runs up the short rapids.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The dream at first occurred in the north country. It was cold and bleak. Great mounds of snow were stretching before me. I looked in the direction of my Ford auto and was startled and frightened at the pack of burly vicious wolves which were running towards it. I ran towards the car with a great burst of speed, opened the door and went in. I felt greatly relieved, however, when I looked in the back seat. My recently married long time friend was necking with his wife which made me feel left out. I stepped on the gas and started, then I spotted a big dog come lumbering towards the car. I tromped down on the accelerator and got out of there. The following transition was amazing. I found myself driving down a long white-paved highway which was abounding on each side with lush green vegetation, and to the right of me was a lake which was teeming with wild ducks. The sight was wonderful after the first experience I had been through.]]></report>

They coaxed me jokingly, but I refused. they then jumped down from the gallery and chased me. I turned around quickly and grabbed each by his thumb exerting pressure on the digit. I led the two men around like bulls by the nose until I saw a policeman to whom I gave custody of the men. I jokingly retorted, "You boys won't be in jail long. Probably for the night -- anyways the rest will do you good." Ironically I said, "They have nice soft beds there. See you again next year boys, when the carnival comes this way?"

However, it then dawned on me that I had nothing to shoot at, so I decided to stop and find something. I stopped at a farm house and went into a barn looking for something to shoot at. I spotted it. Ah, a barrel with a bung-hole, (I couldn't be that hard up) and began to carry it out of the barn. Suddenly the farm woman saw me and told me to put down the barrel. The firmness of the tones of her voice hastened my putting down of the barrel. I made out as if I wanted to buy something, and I gave as an excuse that I wanted to put the articles I bought into the barrel. I then went out of the barn and did buy some tomato plants with ripe tomatoes on them. I then got into my car and remember myself driving home.]]></report>

I gathered my gear together and climbed up the ladder of the aircraft carrier. Another sailor showed me to my locker. I spent quite a bit of time getting the locker open. Finally I stowed all my gear and went back on deck to return to the destroyer and say goodbye to my mother. Upon returning topside I saw that the destroyer had cast off and was moving past the carrier and I wasn't going to get to say goodbye. The dream then ended.]]></report>

I was driving my car up a sidestreet in town looking for the remains of his car. I saw it but it was not badly damaged. Upon arriving at the hospital I entered the operating room. They had already wrapped up Miller's body in rubber sheets and heavy rope. A girl that I am going with was an attending nurse but she didn't seem to recognize me. She is 23.

There were no tracks but evidence that people had been there was seen by the fact that the circular walls (of rock) had scribbling etched on them somewhat as the interior of a phone booth. The farther end was a great ways off, but I could see light in the distance. Also I could hear music. As I continued walking the sound of cascading water drowned out the music. I found that the tunnel opened into a marshland which was strewn with large rocks or boulders. I climbed upon one of the boulders, whereupon I noticed that there were several lead soldiers strewn over it. I tried to line them up in military fashion but the constant slapping of the water over the edge of the rock knocked them over. I put them in my pocket (shirt) and started for a house (which appeared unaccountably) but I seemed top heavy and stumbled and fell into the water. I seemed to spend several hours emptying my pockets of lead soldiers of which there seemed to be an inexhaustible supply.]]></report>

One afternoon while we were cleaning a deer that one of my friends had shot in the morning we smelled smoke and looked up the moutainside to see a small forest fire starting. The cabin had Indian pump guns in it for fires that might start around camp. So Don and I took the two guns and got our horses and started for the fire while Chuck rode for help to the Forest Rangers. When we reached the fire it was getting pretty well out of hand but we held it down so it would spread not too much further, and thought we had things pretty well under control. Then a strong wind got behind the fire and we had to get out and join the rangers who were coming to help us when they saw what happened. They started a back fire and soon the fire was out.]]></report>

We then ran to where the nest was and started to creep up on it when all of a sudden the bird took off with my younger brother. He started to fly low out over a body of water.

There were three men with me and one was a Cuban. At first we started down with one going first and the Cuban right behind me. The only weapon I had was a little gun that looked like a ring and it didn't shoot straight. The first guy fired at me but I just kept on running. Then I ran into a guy with a machine gun right in front of me. I went right over him shooting at him with my gun. Somehow I got through and bullied my way through the last guy and reached the stairs. Then I was awakened.]]></report>

This episode of leaving and returning to the cave recurs several times in the dream until finally the subject resolves to climb to the top.

I would say the height of the hill was about 300 feet. I was attending some college and my mother, brother, and two friends came to visit us. They stayed for a short time, and during that time I was trying to find a baseball game on the radio, but I couldn't.

I looked down to see how far it was. It was so far down that I couldn't see bottom. I knew I would fall eventually. It was just a matter of how long I could hang on to the stone. I became very frightened when my arms started to get weaker and weaker. I finally let loose of the stone and I fell through space. I had a dizzy feeling as I was falling. I was awakened just before hitting bottom.]]></report>

The class was sitting on stiff boards with no backs and as soon as one person moved the teacher was there on top of the student hitting him with a scale (draftsmen). Then the students together revolted against the teacher and they turned the room upside down, but they never touched the teacher. Then the teacher stopped and with a low voice said please be quiet (I think) and everything was the same again with the room back in order.]]></report>

There was a teacher or professor who was giving this test and instead of having the test written out, it was coming over a PA system and we would write the answers down. The room that we were in was big like a hall and it had tables for many more students than were there. These PA systems were put all over the hall and the voice rang through the hall. As I can remember after the test we were marched out in single file and then driven to a barracks then we were locked in. That is all I can remember.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[The dream began with myself standing at a bottom of a short stone stairway leading into a basement hall of a castle. I had on a page's outfit and had a quarter master whistle around my neck and I piped people in and out of the castle. This girl came in but was a common girl so I didn't pipe for her. We talked and somehow we fell in love. Then the king came in to the hall. People hustled around. They had on beautiful clothes and the women had many jewels on too. I gave this girl a beautiful ring and all of a sudden the people were gone and the girl and I were alone in a different room. The king came in. He didn't look familiar, but he was tall and nice-looking. He carried a beautiful robe with pearls on it and trimmed with white ermine fur. He put it around my shoulders and then put a crown on my head and said I was his son and now I was king. Then I went back to the girl. The people left the room and I took the ring I had given her and gave her a large diamond surrounded by three sapphires and some little diamonds. Then I put the other ring on the finger next to it and said that it would be an engagement ring until we were married.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in a big building in which a lot of people lived. It might have been some kind of a dormitory, but it wasn't familiar although I have been in the same room several times before. I went down a hall and turned left. At the end of the hall are suites of faculty members. The room is small with one window. There is a sewing machine in the room, a desk, a table on which there is some kind of machine with a switch on it. In the room are a number of old style goose-necked lamps. I turned on the lamps as I looked for something; can't remember what it was. I went outside with a friend and it was snowing. On a certain street at home downtown in the business district, we were driving an automobile and there were huge trucks like car carriers. Red, a little different from the real thing -- enclosed on the bottom. There were about 10 of them around. My friend was driving in and out of these trucks. I was quite tense when she hit one of the trucks. No one was hurt or even the car damaged.]]></report>

As I sat there waiting I had a tremendous pain in my upper back tooth. To relieve the pain I gritted them. The more the pain the more I gritted them. As a result the tooth began to crumble. Running to the kitchen sink, I spit out piece after piece of broken tooth. (There was no sign of blood.) I returned to the phone and this Stankey was waiting quite impatiently. All the time I wished I hadn't made the call in fact from the very beginning. The result of it, if any at all, I have forgotten.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was walking late one evening up Main Street (in Akron) looking in the store windows. I remember stopping and looking in the store windows several times. One time I stopped and looked at a large figurine -- a black china negro which had fallen face down in a dime store window display. The next window in front of which I stopped contained a large double bed all made with bedspread and all. The unusual feature was the presence of several life-size toy cocker spaniels all over the bed all lying down with faces toward the street. I continued on my way up the street desiring to take in a movie. I remember standing in a long line for a ticket and when I got inside I saw that the place was quite crowded and the feature hadn't started yet. I didn't stop walking, but walked right back outside and ran across the street to another theatre. The cashier girl was closing the office and wasn't going to sell me a ticket at first, but decided she didn't have anything to lose so I went into the movie. The theatre was strangely arranged. It was very, very narrow, drapes were hanging everywhere and the floor was terribly warped. Many persons showed their disgust for my interruption, but I sat, very uncomfortably in the crooked seat on a slant with the floor.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was one of many persons visiting an electric power plant at a dam. A guide was showing all the complicated machinery and turbines to the visitors. Everywhere I seemed to walk one of the dynamos or turbines would stop rotating. The guide would come running and with a swift twist would start them again. There were all kinds of railings and balconies and no order was required as to where the visitors were to be. This being so I found myself with a few others going up an elevator to a higher level. For some reason I was soon on the way down again. Suddenly the car stopped and the elevator girl was frightened. We tried to move it to the next door below but it wouldn't move; we apparently were stuck. Then the lights went out. One of the turbines generating the electricity must have stopped. I cannot remember how it all came out, but I do remember feeling quite disturbed in the plight which encompassed us.]]></report>

They kept breaking as I held the corners as I painted them. The paint was thick, almost like cheese. People kept remarking what a wonderful job I was doing. As I continued my buddy's sister let out a whoop running to the side window. It was her father returning home. I looked out too and saw him driving his car up the driveway. Someone had painted it just as I was painting the crackers. The paint also looked like cheese, very streaked and crumbling where it had dried out in places. The crackers I was working with were to be eaten for supper.]]></report>

The tube shrank up into a piece of rubber like the end of an air pump. The attendant was showing me the puncture. The next thing I knew the attendant was a girl and she began questioning who I was. I told her I had lived in that neighborhood all my life. After a while she recalled having seen me before. She fixed the tube. All the while I was anxious to leave. One of my buddies had just bought a car and he had given me the keys. I was anxious to take a ride.

Gilbert (a close friend of mine) was helping us finish up and was on the roof looking down at the street working. He was off balance and almost fell. I told him to be careful because I couldn't catch him if he fell. My father came over and just about that time Gilbert fell and Dad and I caught him. It seemed very easy. Later I went over to Donna's to say goodbye. I was leaving for school. The rest is not clear because someone woke me up.]]></report>

We didn't have our tickets so we stepped into this building to buy tickets out of some sort of machine. Different colors and prices determined where you would sit. I was the last one to put my money in the machine. It went out of order and I got about 20 of the best tickets free. I joined the other fellows on the street and proceeded to the ball park. The next thing I know is that we were in a large crowd. I saw several people I knew, Gilbert, male, and his sister.]]></report>

They were graduating so he let me run for experience only. I won both the 440 and 880, and was he surprised. I thought I was going to die I was so sick, but I came out ok. My times were the best of the year and those 10 points of mine eventually won the meet. Thereafter the coach paid a little more attention to me.

I called my uncle and told him what happened -- 'someone has stolen the motor out of the car.' We looked around the garage for clues and found the motor in a vacant lot next to the garage. It had been taken apart and scattered all around. It took us two days to put it together.]]></report>

Just when I thought I had escaped, my feet seemed glued to the ground. I remained almost motionless however hard I tried to make my legs move.

Used the stairs, took the wrong door at the bottom and ended up outside. Walked around and went back in entering the lobby first. I think, because of my attire, I had to make a fast exit, so headed for the elevator. Got in and the operator talked and talked. We kept going up and up, past the seventh floor and it puzzled me to feel as if we were still moving up having passed the top floor. The door opened eventually and the operator and a colleague waiting on the roof tried to roll me. I said I only had two bucks on me. To show him I pulled out a bill which was a five. That startled me and both of them pounced on me. With this I awakened.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Was getting ready to play basketball in a big gym that looked brand new. Had a little trouble about getting my uniform but finally secured one. Remember a lot of running around on the court and in the locker room. Recall some actual playing and then leaving the arena with an old friend same age as me. We had two girls around our age, mine being a blond. My date had to get home for some reason, but we were having trouble locating the house even though she lived in it. Finally we reached a street where the names on the right hand side were set high above the street due to the terrain in that territory. We spotted the house, but my friend drove on past. Then he turned around and came back and I took her in. Fade out.]]></report>

The rocks up there are treacherous. We hit the rocks just submerged beneath surface and the boat went over. I kept my head and flipped the boat back over very easily even though the boat is large. It was still full of water, but still floating and we got it to the bank. The next thing I knew we were telling my dad the story. Right away he put us to work carrying lumber. I got mad when he hinted at us that we didn't have any brains. I was just carrying a piece in the cabin when I woke.]]></report>

But here is where her father stepped into the picture. He declared the marriage null and void and through connections, got the marriage annulled. I was amazed at the simplicity of all the procedure and I was relieved that this was so. I was confronted by friends later and they could hardly believe it had happened. Yet I seemed unconcerned and rather relieved that obligations had been severed. The dream faded at that point.]]></report>

I had dinner at Grandma's then went next door to get a ride back downtown. The people who should have been Wells, turned out to be Dreys, Wayne and Jane (more friends). I got my ride down in a cream and brown station wagon, just newly painted. I knew that the Dreys have no station wagon. They were talking of selling the station wagon and getting a new car but were afraid of trade in allowance. The station wagon had been used very hard. Also Truman's new 20% auto tax would hit very hard. Stop at bookstore to get change for some reason not remembered. Jane sees frat pin says, "Frat man now, huh?"]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Riding along a highway in a friend's car (Loren, some town friend) to play a game of golf. Just after entering a fairly long straight away of an S curve we see a car approaching us at a terrific rate of speed. Just after it goes by us this car tries to pass another car at the time another car is coming along. The result is a terrible crash with the passing car getting squeezed like an accordian and the car on the left hand side having its side bashed in. No remembered damage to third car. Knowing full well that unless someone warns the people coming up from the blind curve that there will be more wreckage strewn along the road. Just as I started down the road the state cops came along. Evidently they had been following the speeder. A police helicopter hovering overhead ordered ambulances and other police to the scene. Most of the people I slowed down swore at me first until they learned what had happened. From the screech of tires, everyone was going too fast for the curve. There was also a bridge just after the curve. There was a lot of damage and quite a few people injured. The police drew a diagram of the scene of the accident to have us furnish proof of what happened. The three boys in the car that caused the accident were all young. Only one had a driver's license and he wasn't driving. What happened, I don't know. Woke up just then.]]></report>

Just before we went in we got to laughing about height; the girl said it didn't make any difference. The girl was Marcia, from home, and I had never been out with her or consciously had a desire to do so. At this party was a girl I had been going with just recently. She was wearing a red dress (part of costume for skit told me in advance). Nothing has been said at all about our not dating anymore. Since I leave her alone and concentrate on other women, particularly my date, she begins asking questions as to why and what and why I am moody. I answer that I am not moody or particularly avoiding her.]]></report>

I bought myself a shot of whiskey and stood at the bar drinking it. Right next to me was a big, unshaven man who orderd a double shot and said I would pay for it. The bartender said, "Oh, no," and took it away from him. I then took the double, passed it down as if it were water, picked up my derby and umbrella and started on home. A little further on I passed a beat-up old building that seemed to house both second-hand and new stores. I went in to look around. The first place I stopped was the sports department and looked at golf clubs, golf bag, and golf balls. The bag was an exact replica of the one I wanted, had a zipper all the way down and was big enough to cover me completely. Since I had no money I said I would be back. The owners, who seemed to be one big family, told me to look around. I went into the toy and fabric shops. Lastly I went into a beverage shop where an old man, head of the family, was making coffee. He asked me to have some and I said, "Yes." He was just making a mixture of different brews when I woke up.]]></report>

All the men in the group came from different countries and I was the only one who spoke English. The final question was a math question. After that we were shown our quarters and told not to do any talking at all. Pretty soon I wandered downstairs, picked up a Life magazine and started to read. The article was on the sadistic way the Russians killed their prisoners. Of the three ways the one I most remembered was the one of kicking a person to death. I then went into the head. When I got through I heard a woman say, "You are not supposed to go in there. It's private." I looked around and saw a bed with a very old woman asleep. I then realized I was in the house of a friend.]]></report>

Cheerfully he handed me the one-half of the rule, and as I stared at him questioning his actions, he explained to me that half a slide rule was just as good and besides it occupied less space.

I spoke to people easily and casually but do not remember any of the people and it occurred to me at the time that I did not know them. I kept looking for clothing stores. I had a desire to buy some clothes. I kept looking but couldn't find anything but drug stores, jewelry stores and fruit stores. I became frustrated and started back to my hotel. When I got to my hotel I noticed that on both sides of it was located a jewelry store.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I awoke cast on the beach of an island (presumably shipwrecked) with Janet, a girl from my hometown. We traveled around the whole island and found it to be level, about two miles in circumference and completely uninhabited. We had nothing but the clothes we were wearing. I set to work building a rough lean-to for the night. She gathered a wild grain stalk (either hay or wheat) to make a mattress of a sort. We got all of this material possible to put over us anticipating a cold night. We talked over our plight and made tentative plans for the next day. We retired early. As the night got colder she cuddled close to me. I kissed and embraced her and felt that she was completely mine. I respected her too much to take advantage of her and make love to her. With this thought the dream just trailed off into nothing.]]></report>

Sitting in the last seat on the right hand side was a girl with the looks and body and reputation to start pleasant thoughts. I sat down beside her and started a conversation. What was said seemed unimportant for our mouths moved, but I heard nothing. I began to feel her leg. She didn't resist. I asked for her phone number, which she gave me. This seemed foolish for I can still remember her phone number. By the time I had gone far enough with her to know that we both had the same desires, and that she was willing in any case, my bus stop came. I told her I could call her that night. I got off the bus and the dream ended.]]></report>

They were quite a distance from me, and rather than a game, some sort of batting practice seemed to be in progress. Every once in a while a baseball would come out as far as the place I was standing (or kneeling?). Each time I would get a ball I would keep it. I soon had three. Looking at the balls closely I noticed that none was very hard and that they were quite irregular in shape, though they did retain the size, and approximate shape of an ordinary baseball.]]></report>

I picked up a dry mop (my roommate is a part-time brush salesman and frequently has such in the room). Grasping it by the mop end, I proceeded to go around waking up all the sleepers in the house. This I did by poking them in the chest with the handle of the mop. The last I came to was my roommate (roommates since last September -- his age 24). Instead of the chest I poked him in the genital area and was surprised to find that the handle penetrated into his body to a depth of several inches. I wiggled the mop handle around to waken him, at which time there appeared several other men who seemed to be quite astonished. The last thing I remember was asking him how in the world it had been possible to make the insertion without injuring him. I can't remember what his answer was.]]></report>

The hood and bellows of the camera were white, and formed a long streamlined-looking affair such as no other type of portrait apparatus I've ever seen. At this time I set about diligently to attempt to organize the men and assign them their times of sitting. Suddenly I was reminded of the time and realized that I was already late for some kind of a church group function at some other part of the city. I woke up in the throes of a great inner struggle to try to straighten out the muddled picture-taking situation while still not being any later in getting to the church program.]]></report>

The suggestion was made to leave and go elsewhere for a while. The place chosen was another eating place in the vicinity which had closed for the night. (It is really open all the time.) We knocked on the side door and were admitted to a view of the floor show then in progress. The attraction of the evening was a fraternity brother of mine who was introducing the next act: a group of singers who were to sing in old Scotch dialect. Involved somehow in the dream was a bet in which I lost a sum of money.]]></report>

I started to yell for a gun. We had to kill it before it killed someone. The owner of the house came running in clad in undershorts only and handed me an old bolt action rifle with a white handle, and a box of bullets marked M-1404 B. 30 cal.

My brother-in-law came through the door and then I looked over at my mother, but she wasn't there anymore. In her place was my sister, the brother-in-law's wife. They each let out with a whoop and kissed each other.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was climbing up a mountain slope through a dense forest of evergreens. It was dark and cold and a thick mist hung low in the woods. I had the feeling that I had been climbing for hours and hours. In some way although it was not actually visible, I could see the top of the mountain, a great, white gleaming mass of ice and snow. I felt somehow that everything was against my ever reaching the top, but at the same time I had an odd feeling of confidence in the fact that nothing could stop me from reaching it. Next I found myself at timberline and looked back down over the miles of forest through which I had climbed. I suddenly felt marvelously happy and laughed and shouted, "Fools, fools," at person or persons unknown below me. Then I turned again toward the summit which now seemed very near and awe-inspiring in its beauty. I woke feeling very lighthearted and was quite disappointed when I found that I had been only dreaming.]]></report>

On this sits a short dark-haired slender girl. She is very pretty and stimulates me sexually immediately. She stretches and says something to me in a foreign tongue which I answer but I did not understand it. I remove my coat and throw it on a chair and sit down next to her. Suddenly I feel very sorry for her and begin to cry and say, "It's all my fault. They'll pay for this." I take her in my arms and stroke her hair at the same time, muttering, "You poor unknowing, unseeing little creature -- what a damned filthy trick." She then says in a very sweet voice with a slight French accent (I once was quite familiar with a French-Canadian girl with a French accent), "It is all right, Jimmy. Soon we will be up in the sky again." I woke up, feeling very blue.]]></report>

In the next scene my friends are all lined up before a large firing squad and are about to be executed. The officer in charge gives the commands, "Ready, aim -- " and just then I cry that some enemy has attacked Toledo and that all the guardsmen must hurry to its defense. The officer stops the execution and hurries off with his firing squad.

I remember thinking, "I'll have to think it all out. No, there's no need for thinking any more. The whole problem is resolved. This is the final solution." I was conscious of a gentle swelling and sinking feeling as if I were drifting in the sea.

I lay on my bed for a while and then heard someone coming up the stairs to my room. I tried to call out and ask who it was but was unable to speak. The footsteps slowly came closer and at last entered my bedroom. I saw the person, evidently a man, and was overcome with fear. I tried to get up to get to my gun rack which is just outside my bedroom door, but I was unable to move. Finally, just before I awoke, I was released from the spell and dashed to my gunrack. I took out a rifle and turned to face the unknown visitor, only to find that it was a small boy who was greatly concerned over my apparent desire to harm him. I felt rather foolish at becoming so terrified at the presence of such a small child and then woke up.]]></report>

One wall was lined with bunks five high. I was in the top bunk. A door was in the wall that was perpendicular to the beds. The room was not painted and was not plastered but covered with cement and had the gloomy gray color of cement. The blankets of the bed were pulled up to my neck and were of a blackish gray. A guard (whom I didn't know and whose age I didn't notice) came into the room with a package for me. I tried to get out of the bunk to get the package. I threw the covers back but I couldn't get down to the floor.]]></report>

I then had the feeling of safety and reassurance. Scene changed to the main floor of a large department store. Up to now all persons in dream were male, unknown to me and ages were not observed. In the store I saw one of the persons we were chasing. I then realized that he was a good friend of mine. The person who was with me and seeking the prisoners was unknown and older than me (between 30 and 40). My friend (the prisoner) was walking down a flight of stairs from the second floor to the first floor. I saw his head over a show case. The scene now had my friend in a show case. I talked to him but I couldn't hear what I said. I took the gun and squeezed the trigger. The gun may have shot and it may not have. At the time I didn't think it did. My friend then said he was sorry and that he was glad to have known me. Then he said goodbye. Then the scene changed. I was in a strange bed. My mother woke me and told me my friend had died on the way to the hospital. I started to sob. Then I began to wonder whether I had shot my friend or not.]]></report>

The audience thought it was part of the performance and applauded.]]></report>

I was eating dinner when all of a sudden a shout outdoors could be heard saying that we were being invaded by a nomadic infidel tribe. My reactions to this statement were those of fear and anger and quickly I sought to arm myself. Before I could accomplish this the enemy had entered the house. I among others were seized as prisoners. Next we were taken to a sort of jungle and told that our trial was coming up next. I looked out of the hut door and saw a person with a multitude of hideous sores tied to a stake. He screamed and I was told that an enemy was pouring cups of lemon juice over the open cuts. At this I woke up and after I awoke I could seem to continue to hear the screams.]]></report>

All of a sudden the auto began to spin crazily in circles, as one spins when skidding in snow. I was overcome with anxiety for I anticipated an accident. As much as I tried I could not control the auto nor could I see where we were going. The windows were frosted and therefore a view was not to be had. After I could hear the screeching of brakes and awaited the crash but nothing happrned. At length the auto stopped spinning and I again pursued my original course.]]></report>

What street it was I cannot tell although I am very familiar with the municipal thoroughfares of Cleveland. Snow blanketed the ground and the streets shone like glass. Suddenly the car went completely out of control and a dense fog appeared before my eyes through which I could see oncoming headlights but nothing else. Everything appeared to be gray and the car began turning complete circles as rapidly as a whirling dervish. Vainly I attempted to get the car under control but the more I tried the more the car spun. I began getting sick to my stomach and waited for an accident to occur but nothing happened. I heard horns blaring and people shouting but from whence they came I knew not. The car stopped spinning and I woke up happy to discover that it was only a dream.]]></report>

I commented often that her uniform would get dirty if she didn't stop drinking. It seemed as a matter of fact that we ended up in her hotel room and were indulging in sex play. She kept seducing me on but never would quite submit to intercourse. After repeated attempts we went to bed together and indulged in intercourse. At that time the dream was terminated by a nocturnal emission.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was seated at a card table playing poker with three other men. I was losing and felt that I should be winning. I had the impression that the game was unfair. In fact I was the only one losing. The other three men had lower cards than I did, but for some reason I was letting them take the money. They were kidding me about it and I was getting mad. On the next deal I showed everyone my cards, which were the highest on the table, but the other three men took the money and divided it among themselves. I once again showed them my cards and asked why I could not take the money. They gave no answer. I then picked up an ashtray from the table and started threatening them. In a fit of anger I threw it at a cat that suddenly appeared in the room. I hit the cat and felt relieved. The other three men excused themselves and left the room. I was looking for an answer as to how I could get my money back, but I never found one. The dream ended.]]></report>

Suddenly I found myself wearing a pair of rubber hip boots and was overjoyed at the protection they offered. Other than the hip boots however, I was completely naked. I frantically tried to force open a door leading to another room and finally succeeded. The next room was also filled with water, but there were many hats floating on the surface. I then noticed hundreds of brown overcoats hanging on the walls above the level of the water. I wanted to get a dry one to put on, but every coat I came to was soaking wet. The same was true of every hat. After trying all the hats and coats and finding them all wet, I started to cry and that was as much of the dream as I remembered.]]></report>

After a while my friend and I seemed to be trapped by these same four fellows and were trying to figure a way of escape.

In the next scene I was racing with another automobile to the one remining space in a parking lot. I succeeded in reaching the space first and was greatly satisfied. The third and last scene returned to the body in the cardboard box. Although I was positive that I was the perpetrator it turned out that another man confessed to the murder.

As I was walking along I gradually became aware of a scantily clad girl walking a short distance ahead of me. As I was looking up at her with some degree of surprise at her attire she turned around and smiled at me and began running on ahead. I started to give chase running faster and faster but never quite catching up to her. The dream ended with this little game of run and chase with an emission.

As I scrambled over each successive pair of tracks I remember looking down the shiny rails and seeing locomotives approaching from a distance. I got across the five or six pairs of parallel rails unscathed and found myself walking on a bright steel platform. As I walked along, the steel sides of the ramp angled in until they joined in a small room. I entered the room and found that it was an elevator. I was vaguely conscious that there were several other people in the elevator besides myself. After our descent seemingly underground, I found myself a prisoner of soldiers who I took to be Germans by their uniforms and incoherent speech. I was marched down a long corridor and finally confined in a small room with a guard. The dream ended here.]]></report>

Following this I found myself aboard an airliner bound for Florida. Again in this scene was the same member of the faculty and likewise we exchange some remarks which I am unable to recall. The last scene of this dream transpired on the front porch of my house. From where I was sitting I saw a large airplane fly over my house and as it was flying along it fired several blasts releasing a cloud of black smoke each time. The plane landed on the street and as it landed it became a much smaller craft. A woman (age 30) a friend, got out. I asked her to take me up for a ride, but she refused because she had just paid $3000 for a new carburator. Dream ended at this point.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in a store such as a Burrows store and purchased four new bright blue desk tops. They were about 18 inches wide, 30 inches long and made of a thin plywood-like material. They had a piece attached on the back with a slab in it for their attachment to a stand, something like a music stand. I took them to class and gave three of them to other pupils, keeping one for myself. the teacher was a woman, 28, and is not only one of my instructors here at Reserve, but is also the young lady I have been dating quite a bit lately and am very fond of. For some reason or other I soon painted my desk top a duller color, pinkish brown. The teacher seemed to be quite pleased with the desks and so was I. I think some of the other students might have resented it.]]></report>

They may have been my sister and one of her girlfriends, ages 19. I was supposed to be studying my German homework, but found myself reading and discussing an army handbook on field artillery. The front door bell rang and in came a fraternity brother of mine with a large double decker birthday cake. I asked why the cake and he said that he had received one the week before and now it was my turn. My dad asked him if he had been out to Eisely's place, meaning John Carroll U and he answered that he was applying to their med school (they have none) next week. My dad said that he had better hurry and he returned that he liked Reserve and Case better anyhow and that they were damn good schools.]]></report>

When I asked him where it was being held he said in Florida and that he wasn't going since it was so far. I said I thought I would drive down since I wanted to break in my new Ford convertible that I was driving. I told him I was going to get three other guys and drive down. The picnic was to be the very next day. I drove home and was looking the car over in the backyard when my dad, 54, appeared. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was going to drive down to Mentor. I then corrected myself and said I mean Florida. I told him I wanted to see how the car performed and I would find out what kind of mileage I was getting. My dad told me that if I wasn't getting good mileage, I should stop in any garage and they would put on a new carburetor free since they were guaranteed for good mileage.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I seemed to join up with a man who was starting a revolution. It was just to be a small thing and began in a little village. My friend was older, perhaps 40. We had other male followers also. As the revolution proceeded we became more powerful until we were sweeping the country and world. I was in charge of fueling our vehicles although I only had a few barrels of gas and oil. We had huge stores of war surplus weapons and a few new [illegible]. Our ace in the hole was a huge ape about 30 feet tall and very powerful. As we were transporting him to a new scene of battle his specially built truck went over a cliff and the ape broke loose and became uncontrollable. He chased another friend (a pal in real life, 20, who just now comes into the dream) and me. We began climbing a huge tree. My friend was tired and kept slipping. We finally got to the top but my friend slipped and fell to his apparent death below. I descended and with a few friends performed an operation on the ape and restored him to his former human form. He became our friend. He had been previously turned into this monster by someone we knew nothing of.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[Myself, and four or five companions of the same age, all male, got out of our car at some place that was like Mentor Park. It was winter and the place was abandoned. Ice was all over the ground. We walked across an open area and as we passed through some passageway we found ourselves threading our way down a sunny mountain trail looking for gold. We noticed other groups coming after us. We finally came out into a great field with a jungle in the distance. We noticed small animals resembling pigs running around. As we got into the jungle proper which was very light and sunny we saw all sort of wildlife. Lions, giraffes, pythons, standing out most in my mind. For safety we decided to climb trees. I first climbed a small tree but found it was not safe enough so I came down and began to climb a large tent pole which I had not noticed before. As I did so I had a nocturnal emission and awoke.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was walking up a highway going uphill. Just ahead of me I saw the father (age 50) of a childhood playmate of mine. He had a tank strapped to his back. From the tank ran a hose to the bottom part of a broom which he was sweeping the highway with. The water from the tank would come out of the hose just at the bristle of the broom so as he swept he also washed the highway. I took the contraption and started sweeping the highway. I couldn't understand why the highway could be dirty since it had rained two nights previously. Then I remembered that it had snowed the night previously. This seemed to explain to me why the highway was so dirty.]]></report>

I was asking the men (very wealthy looking) for a handout when they walked out the door of this one building which I was standing in front of. When finally one man came out who resembled my father and threw me a coin which I missed, it rolled down the sidewalk and into a little stairway that led to the basement of one of the buildings. When I walked down the steps where the coin had rolled I saw the entire stairway was filled with coins and bills of all denominations. I then leaped into the huge pile of money at the foot of the stairs and began to let the coins and bills run through my hands. I seemed to enjoy the feeling of having the money cover my entire body. I then began to stack the bills and coins very neatly in one corner when my dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was walking over an open field that had a low-lying mist about my feet. I was with a little baby girl about four years old. I was holding her one hand and I believe a woman was holding her left. She was a little vague. We came to a cliff and the baby tried to jump off of it but we held her hand and kept her from it. Then the scene was in an auditorium and we were walking across the stage when the child broke loose again and this time jumped from the stage and fell to the floor on her head. Then I saw a woman playing a piano and I knew it was this little girl's mother. How I don't know, but I knew I associated her with the little girl in this manner. Then the woman opened a drawer of a desk and the woman and a few others all had a very surprised expression on their face and it was one of shock and horror. I myself could not see what was in the drawer but knew it must be something very horrible. The woman reached in the drawer and very tenderly lifted out the 88 keys of the piano which were all tied together in one long string. They all began to weep. They then opened the second drawer (which I could not see what was in it either) and she took out the piano legs and strings. They then opened the third drawer and the mother tenderly lifted out the arms and legs and body of the little child I had been walking with. Each time they opened a drawer they would have this very startled expression on their face. The dream ended here.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was in a schoolyard (the schoolyard of my 12th year). It was very sunny out in the yard. There were a great many students in the yard. They were not grade school pupils, but they were instead college students. I felt that it was Indiana University. I then went into the office as they handed me a class card. I then found myself in another room. This was a classroom and I found that I had signed for a course in typing and Dr. Harris of the philosophy dept. here at Reserve was the instructor. I asked him if he hadn't taught at Reserve and he said that he hadn't. While talking to him I was making side comments to the class. One that I can remember is that I said I'll bet I COULD pass this course if I played football. And they replied, "Well, why don't you?" Then they noticed how small I was and laughed. Here the dream ended.]]></report>

Suddenly I heard gunfire (of heavy pieces). Then I heard the scream of rocket bombs and everything began to explode around us. We were the only ones on the street and we began to run as fast as we could. Finally we went into this house and up many flights of stairs till we came to the last floor and the very topmost room of the house. When I opened the door a bomb hit the room. The dream then ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[This dream took place in a war surplus goods shop, one very much like the shop downtown. I was in the shop and had just won a contest which I thought entitled me to anything in the place. I went from counter to counter and picked out what I wanted, socks, gloves, etc. I remember very clearly that I picked out an army flying jacket. I had wanted a good leather jacket but they didn't have any. I had piled up a pretty large amount of merchandise and was about to leave when the clerk came over and told me that my prize amounted to only five dollars toward any purchase. I put most of the merchandise back where I had gotten it. At this point the dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I was out for a ride in my car. My girl and her sister were along. Betty's sister, Gladys, has a driver's license so I let her drive the car for a while. I remember that we got off the main road and were driving up and down hills on a side road. Gladys is a good driver and she wasn't breaking any laws. I remember this very distinctly. However, as we were going down one of the hills we were stopped by a police car. As we stopped I asked Gladys if she had her license with her. She said no and became rather angry. Instead of the cop coming up to me in the car, he just sat there in his and I had to go back to him. He wouldn't tell me what we had done wrong, but gave me a ticket anyway. The police car was a very odd affair, being gray, very long. As a matter of fact, it was more like a bus than a police car. After the police had driven off I began to think the situation over and it burned me up. I was about to go to the police station and demand an explanation when the dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I had entered a town which had just been taken over by a gang of criminals. Business was going on as usual, but everywhere there were people walking around with machine guns, etc. on their arms. I remember that I went to the barber shop to get a haircut. As I went in I noticed a man out in front who was collecting money, taxes or something of the sort. Everyone who came up to him paid him in coin and called him sir. The man's appearance (personal) was very obscure. I sat down, was conscious of someone alongside of me but couldn't tell who it was. As I was sitting there, a man came in the shop and looked in my direction. He said, "I thought I saw a couple of faces back there." As he came back to me I couldn't make out anything about him because of the haze. He put both hands on my face and said, "You have a professional face." Then his hands started towards my neck and I had the feeling that he was going to choke me. I took hold of both of his wrists and pushed him away.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I was someplace in the Orient with two friends visiting a small state which had just been taken over by a dictatorship. The rule was strictly by the military. The section I was in was undermined by huge caverns. It seems that all of the political prisoners, etc. were kept at work in these caves. My friends and I wanted to visit the caves and take a look around so we procured passes from the local chief. After we had seen enough we started to leave. I remember that we walked up a long tunnel. As we neared the guards my friends took out their passes and I reached for mine. It was gone. When I told this to the man at the gate, he looked at me sternly, called a huge subordinate and pointing to me, said, "Take him below." I became very alarmed, protesting that I was an American citizen. Finally, as a last resort, I showed my my war department AGO card. This convinced him and he turned me loose.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I was high up in a building. I remember it as being on the 21st story. It seems that the building was built in the shape of a square with a very large open center. While I was up there a battle suddenly developed in the open space inside the building. It was complex, even to the point of airplanes flying around, shooting at each other. I took part in the battle for a while, shooting at the airplanes which were flying around level with my position. While this was going on the enemy with foot soldiers took the first floor of the building. I realized that I was on the losing side and began looking for some means of making my escape. It was not clear in the dream, as to how I did it, but I remember sliding, as on a circular chute from floor to floor and finally to the first floor and out past my astonished would-be captors. At this point the dream ended.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[My twin brother Seymour and I were among a large number of soldiers arriving at an Army airfield in Japan. Several other GIs were boarding planes for return to the United States. Both of us were very happy to learn that we were returning home tomorrow by air. Our group was divided into units of six men each. I was number 11; my brother number 12. The first unit left at 12 o'clock. Our group was to take off at 2 o'clock. Before leaving I told number 13 that he was unlucky as his unit wouldn't leave till the following day. Then my brother and I were in a small plane the pilot of which was Capt. Arnold (m, 26, an officer in our unit while I was in service). Though our group was supposed to be composed of six men; only my brother and I and the pilot were in the airplane. The three of us were in the pilot's cabin when Capt. Arnold went to the rear of the plane instructing me to take over the controls. That was the end of the dream.]]></report>

After picking up my date, we waited for a phone call from Mort. By 11:30 he had not called as my date, my brother and I drove out to the dance. Mort and his date were already there. We then drove back on a road with streetcar tracks. I left my brother at his date's house and went to my house to change clothes (for some unknown reason). While at my house, my date (age 19) and I were alone. We were waiting for my brother to call. I thought to myself that this was an opportune moment to make love to my date.

The most unusual feature however, was the fact that the house faced sideways. It was between two large houses. And when I saw our house I was very surprised and very keenly disappointed.

We were walking along the sidewalks laughing and talking although I can't recall any words I was saying. There is a bridge in Rocky River by the Westlake Hotel which I pass on my way home. In the dream we walked onto the approach to the bridge and prepared to cross over it. As we walked onto it, the others dropped back a little and I was all alone. Suddenly it began to hail and the others ran into a gas station to escape the very large stones that fell. I was caught on the bridge and was undecided which way to go as I was afraid I would be hurt by the stones. the others yelled at me that I would get hurt so I rushed back across the bridge and ducked into a small shed in which was the colored gas station attendant.]]></report>

There was a road down which we were walking and which was lined with tall straight trees. The scene shifted and I was walking around a muddy cliff but the youth was still there. We were standing there in the mud and I saw a huge snake crawling in a crevass in the cliff. I told the youth with me and we walked to a car where I got a gun and a pocket full of bullets and began walking back to the cliff. One the way we went through a covered bridge and I began to fondle the rifle and the bullets in the pockets of my jacket. I began to load the rifle and to laugh. We got back to the cliff and I saw the snake again. I fired the rifle and it did not go off, but the snake suddenly seemed to split open.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[In this dream I dreamt that I was walking along a path that was in a suburb and there was a river in the valley. I thought to myself I wish I had a fishing pole and I could go fishing. The scene shifted and I was wading along the river fishing with a flyrod. The river was very dirty and shallow where I was fishing and the bottom was very muddy and sticky. I saw how dirty the water was and decided that I would walk up the river and try to find deeper and cleaner water where I could fish. I walked along the river bank until I saw faster and clearer water. I reentered the river and began to fish again. I had no luck and was about to go further up river when I saw two fishermen coming down the river. They came up to me and I saw they were two friends of mine about 28 years old with whom I frequently go fishing. I asked them whether they had caught any fish and they answered yes. I asked them if they would give me some bait and they said it was all gone. It then began to rain and we began to run back to town. The path was very straight and lined with trees. We hardly got wet. It was lightning very hard when we got into town. A man drove past in a blue Chevrolet coupe and yelled.]]></report>

It did not seem to agitate me very much except that it surprised me. I thought to myself that since I was taken from college I should be an officer. I looked at my uniform and saw that it was a second lieutenant's suit. I became very pleased and began to whisper to a passerby that I was a bigshot. The passerby seemed to be shadowy and vague. I began to get hungry and I thought I would go up and eat with the general. I walked a little ways until I came to a white building and I went in. There was a fat man about 50 sitting in a chair (the general) and a sergeant about 30 was cooking breakfast. The sergeant looked just like a bartender that I know in my hometown. When I told them this they began to laugh.]]></report>

She feels a bit out of place. We are in a Jewish crowd and she is the only Christian girl there. Besides everyone thinks she is a whore which I am both suspicious and hopeful of. I notice that she is ill at ease and we walk away and go to a platform from which we watch the sea. I have clasped her hand and I am overcome with tenderness for her. (I think she is wearing her usher's uniform. During the dream I noticed that she was flat-breasted.) We admire with poetic sensitivity, the sea. I ask her whether I might kiss her. She said she did not mind but told me she was incapable of passion. I did not mind too much.]]></report>

She kept saying I'd get sick, but I was determined to prove to her that I could drink more than she could. I got sick again under the same circumstances. We had quite a time and decided to go home. She wanted to go right home, but I wanted to make violent love. We had an argument about it. She said we couldn't if I was going to get sick everytime we drank beer. I felt ashamed and decided to quit drinking. She told me that wasn't necessary.]]></report>

I ran to the door but she ran after me. I knew that her only wish was for me to shoot her. I pulled the trigger and then I began to laugh.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I dreamt that I went swimming in a deep pool that was not familiar to me. I took all my clothes off and put them on the bank. I began swimming. When I finished I got out of the pool. I began looking for my clothes but I couldn't find them. Suddenly I saw a girl holding the clothes and beckoning me to come with her. She began running and I ran after her. She put my clothes in a cave and disappeared.]]></report>

			<report><![CDATA[I was sitting on a throne of gold surrounded by beautiful girls. The girls kept pawing me and I kept chasing them away. Suddenly one girl stood up and came close to me. I was surprised by her good looks. She bent down and kissed me. I felt thrilled. I put my arms around her and picked her up. We danced for a while. I was taken by her beauty. She was a most beautiful creature. I went wherever she went. I received a thrill every time she touched me. I wanted her badly. The next, I believe we were both floating in the clouds completely nude. We were pleasantly talking and laughing. We were dancing and singing suddenly, extremely happy. I continually kissed the girl, and she reciprocated. We stood arm in arm rolling on.]]></report>

I tried to stop the car but my foot couldn't find the brake. I frantically looked for the brakes but they had disappeared. Suddenly in front of me on the road was my girl.

			<report><![CDATA[I was standing near the bank of a river. The surroundings were dark and suspicious and I was afraid. I suddenly felt myself falling into space without even coming to a halt. Suddenly I plunged into the icy cold water. I could not swim. I cried for help. I heard someone calling and coming toward me. He began laughing at me. I looked at him. He was an old schoolmate of mine whom I detested. He laughed again and said he would let me drown. I screamed and as rapidly as I screamed he laughed. I felt myself drowning but he wouldn't help me. Then the scene became blank. I plunged into darkness fighting for breath. I was afraid. I felt a pressure against me. I wanted help but received only a little laugh. I could do nothing as the water pressed into me.]]></report>
