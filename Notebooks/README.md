# Towards Automatic Scoring of Dream Reports

The notebooks contain the steps and experiments of the work. 

- Collect_Data_and_Embeddings: extracts the desired features (i.e., general and dreamer emotioms) from the Dream Bank .xlm file, and gathers the LM embeddings.

- DATA_Visualisation: visualises the data distributions and K-Mean clusters

- Unsupervised_Sentiment_Analysis: collection and analysis of unsupervised sentiment analysis experiments. 

- Supervised_Multi_Label: single and k-fold experiments on the supervised multi-label text classification.
