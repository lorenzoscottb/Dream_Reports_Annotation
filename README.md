# [Automatic Scoring of Dream Reports' Emotional Content with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14828)

This repository contains the code, results, and analysis of the work on automatically annotating dream reports' emotional content. The annotation process is largely based on pre-trained largel language models (LLMs), implemented via Hugging Face ü§ó. 

Since you are here, you'd likely be interested in checking out [`DReAMy`](https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/DReAMy) üò¥üìùü§ñ!

# Content
## Experiments

The work revolvs around two main set of experiments:

- Unsupervised sentiment analysis
- Supervised text classification

Code for each set of experiments can be found in the dedicated folders inside the `Experiments` folders.

## Analysis

The analysis of the collected results can be found in the dedicated jupiter notebooks.

## Results 

The results and predictions collected in all the experiments. 

# Trained Models
The follwing sections explain how to use the different deployed models. You can either follow the instructions or jump [here](https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/Dream_Reports_Annotation/blob/main/Analysis/trained_model_testing.ipynb) to see a use-case of both with jupiter notebook.

## Main model
A link to downloaded the weights of the main model can be found in the `Experiments/Supervised_Learning` section, together with the code used to tune the the model, collect the predictions preseted in the paper, as well as a basic usage example.

### Download and usage 
You can find a use-case example of the main model, together with the link to download the weights [here](https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/Dream_Reports_Annotation/tree/main/Experiments/Supervised_Learning)

## [DReAMy](https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/DReAMy) and Secondary ü§ó models 
While the main model achieves the best and most stable results, it is based on a custom architecture. Hence, setting up a classification pipeline requires more coding and dependecies. For this reason, together with the main deployed model, we trained and open-sourced few more models, which are two LLMs "simply" tuned as `multi-label` classifiers, and solely using the the standard ü§ó trainer pipeline. Despite Achiving a (sligtly) lower performance, these models posses other desireble features. To start, they can be directly dowladed and used via the ü§ó ```transformers``` library. Moreover, one can annotate dreams in 94 languages, while the other is based on a (English-only) "small" LLM encoder, hence rquireing signficantly less computational power. 

### Usage
These (and more) models (and functinality) can be directly used via [`DReAMy`](https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/DReAMy), the first NLP and AI based python library to analyse dream reports. Se the code below for a usage-example of DReAMy.

```py
import dreamy 

# get some dreams to classify
test_dreams = [
    "In my dream, I was followed by the scary monster.",
    "I was walking in a forest, surrounded by singing birds. I was calm and at peace."
]

# Setup mode and classification function
classification_type = "presence"
model_type          = "base-en"
return_type         = "distribution" # set "present" for above-threshold only
device              = "cpu"

predictions = dreamy.predict_emotions(
    dream_as_list, 
    classification_type, 
    model_type,
    return_type=return_type, 
    device=device,
)

predictions

# print the probability associated with each Hall & Van de Castle emotion:
# anger (AN) apprehension (AP), sadness (SD), confusion (CO), happiness (HA)
predictions

## Data
### Labelled Dream Reports
As specified in the paper, the labelled data is frely availeb fro consulation via the Dream Bank website. The labelled data adopted in the supervised experiment consists of an xlm version of Dream Bank availabe upon request to the Dream Bank team.

### Full Dream Bank
The unlabelled-data analysis was possible thanks to the [Dream Bank (and pre-scraped) data scraper](https://github.com/mattbierner/DreamScrape) from Matt Bierner.
